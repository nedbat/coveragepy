Change history for Coverage.py
------------------------------

Version 3.2b2
-------------

- Fixed some problems syntax coloring sources with line continuations and
  source with tabs: `issue 30`_ and `issue 31`_.

- Classes are no longer incorrectly marked as branches: `issue 32`_.

- "except" clauses with types are no longer incorrectly marked as branches:
  `issue 35`_.

- The --omit option now works much better than before, fixing `issue 33`_.
  Thanks, Danek Duvall.

Version 3.2b1, 10 November 2009
-------------------------------

- Branch coverage!

- XML reporting has file paths that let Cobertura find the source code.

- The tracer code has changed, it's a few percent faster.

- Some exceptions reported by the command line interface have been cleaned up
  so that tracebacks inside coverage.py aren't shown.  Fixes `issue 23`_.

Version 3.1, 4 October 2009
---------------------------

- Source code can now be read from eggs.  Thanks, rozza.  Fixes `issue 25`_

.. _issue 25: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/25


Version 3.1b1, 27 September 2009
--------------------------------

- Python 3.1 is now supported.

- Coverage.py has a new command line syntax with sub-commands.  This expands
  the possibilities for adding features and options in the future.  The old
  syntax is still supported.  Try "coverage help" to see the new commands.
  Thanks to Ben Finney for early help.

- Added an experimental "coverage xml" command for producing coverage reports
  in a Cobertura-compatible XML format.  Thanks, Bill Hart.

- Added the --timid option to enable a simpler slower trace function that works
  for DecoratorTools projects, including TurboGears.  Fixed `issue 12`_ and
  `issue 13`_.

- HTML reports show modules from other directories.  Fixed `issue 11`_.

- HTML reports now display syntax-colored Python source.

- Programs that change directory will still write .coverage files in the
  directory where execution started.  Fixed `issue 24`_.

- Added a "coverage debug" command for getting diagnostic information about the
  coverage.py installation.

.. _issue 13: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/13
.. _issue 24: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/24


Version 3.0.1, 7 July 2009
--------------------------

- Removed the recursion limit in the tracer function.  Previously, code that
  ran more than 500 frames deep would crash. Fixed `issue 9`.

- Fixed a bizarre problem involving pyexpat, whereby lines following XML parser
  invocations could be overlooked.  Fixed `issue 10`.

- On Python 2.3, coverage.py could mis-measure code with exceptions being
  raised.  This is now fixed.

- The coverage.py code itself will now not be measured by coverage.py, and no
  coverage modules will be mentioned in the nose --with-cover plug-in.  Fixed
  `issue 8`.

- When running source files, coverage.py now opens them in universal newline
  mode just like Python does.  This lets it run Windows files on Mac, for
  example.

.. _issue 10: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/10
.. _issue 8: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/8


Version 3.0, 13 June 2009
-------------------------

- Fixed the way the Python library was ignored.  Too much code was being
  excluded the old way.
  
- Tabs are now properly converted in HTML reports.  Previously indentation was
  lost.  Fixed `issue 6`.
  
- Nested modules now get a proper flat_rootname.  Thanks, Christian Heimes.

.. _issue 6: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/6


Version 3.0b3, 16 May 2009
--------------------------

- Added parameters to coverage.__init__ for options that had been set on the
  coverage object itself.
  
- Added clear_exclude() and get_exclude_list() methods for programmatic
  manipulation of the exclude regexes.

- Added coverage.load() to read previously-saved data from the data file.

- Improved the finding of code files.  For example, .pyc files that have been
  installed after compiling are now located correctly.  Thanks, Detlev
  Offenbach.

- When using the object API (that is, constructing a coverage() object), data
  is no longer saved automatically on process exit.  You can re-enable it with
  the auto_data=True parameter on the coverage() constructor. The module-level
  interface still uses automatic saving.


Version 3.0b2, 30 April 2009
----------------------------

HTML reporting, and continued refactoring.

- HTML reports and annotation of source files: use the new -b (browser) switch.
  Thanks to George Song for code, inspiration and guidance.

- Code in the Python standard library is not measured by default.  If you need
  to measure standard library code, use the -L command-line switch during
  execution, or the cover_pylib=True argument to the coverage() constructor.

- Source annotation into a directory (-a -d) behaves differently.  The
  annotated files are named with their hierarchy flattened so that same-named
  files from different directories no longer collide.  Also, only files in the
  current tree are included.

- coverage.annotate_file is no longer available.

- Programs executed with -x now behave more as they should, for example,
  __file__ has the correct value.

- .coverage data files have a new pickle-based format designed for better
  extensibility.

- Removed the undocumented cache_file argument to coverage.usecache().


Version 3.0b1, 7 March 2009
---------------------------

Major overhaul.

- Coverage is now a package rather than a module.  Functionality has been split
  into classes.

- The trace function is implemented in C for speed.  Coverage runs are now
  much faster.  Thanks to David Christian for productive micro-sprints and
  other encouragement.

- Executable lines are identified by reading the line number tables in the
  compiled code, removing a great deal of complicated analysis code.
  
- Precisely which lines are considered executable has changed in some cases.
  Therefore, your coverage stats may also change slightly.

- The singleton coverage object is only created if the module-level functions
  are used.  This maintains the old interface while allowing better
  programmatic use of Coverage.
  
- The minimum supported Python version is 2.3.
 

Version 2.85, 14 September 2008
-------------------------------

- Add support for finding source files in eggs. Don't check for
  morf's being instances of ModuleType, instead use duck typing so that
  pseudo-modules can participate. Thanks, Imri Goldberg.
  
- Use os.realpath as part of the fixing of file names so that symlinks won't
  confuse things. Thanks, Patrick Mezard.


Version 2.80, 25 May 2008
-------------------------

- Open files in rU mode to avoid line ending craziness. Thanks, Edward Loper.


Version 2.78, 30 September 2007
-------------------------------

- Don't try to predict whether a file is Python source based on the extension.
  Extension-less files are often Pythons scripts. Instead, simply parse the file
  and catch the syntax errors. Hat tip to Ben Finney.


Version 2.77, 29 July 2007
--------------------------

- Better packaging.


Version 2.76, 23 July 2007
--------------------------

- Now Python 2.5 is *really* fully supported: the body of the new with
  statement is counted as executable.


Version 2.75, 22 July 2007
--------------------------

- Python 2.5 now fully supported. The method of dealing with multi-line
  statements is now less sensitive to the exact line that Python reports during
  execution. Pass statements are handled specially so that their disappearance
  during execution won't throw off the measurement.


Version 2.7, 21 July 2007
-------------------------

- "#pragma: nocover" is excluded by default.

- Properly ignore docstrings and other constant expressions that appear in the
  middle of a function, a problem reported by Tim Leslie.

- coverage.erase() shouldn't clobber the exclude regex. Change how parallel
  mode is invoked, and fix erase() so that it erases the cache when called
  programmatically.

- In reports, ignore code executed from strings, since we can't do anything
  useful with it anyway.
  
- Better file handling on Linux, thanks Guillaume Chazarain.

- Better shell support on Windows, thanks Noel O'Boyle.

- Python 2.2 support maintained, thanks Catherine Proulx.

- Minor changes to avoid lint warnings.


Version 2.6, 23 August 2006
---------------------------

- Applied Joseph Tate's patch for function decorators.

- Applied Sigve Tjora and Mark van der Wal's fixes for argument handling.

- Applied Geoff Bache's parallel mode patch.

- Refactorings to improve testability. Fixes to command-line logic for parallel
  mode and collect.


Version 2.5, 4 December 2005
----------------------------

- Call threading.settrace so that all threads are measured. Thanks Martin
  Fuzzey.
  
- Add a file argument to report so that reports can be captured to a different
  destination.

- coverage.py can now measure itself.

- Adapted Greg Rogers' patch for using relative file names, and sorting and
  omitting files to report on.


Version 2.2, 31 December 2004
-----------------------------

- Allow for keyword arguments in the module global functions. Thanks, Allen.


Version 2.1, 14 December 2004
-----------------------------

- Return 'analysis' to its original behavior and add 'analysis2'. Add a global
  for 'annotate', and factor it, adding 'annotate_file'.


Version 2.0, 12 December 2004
-----------------------------

Significant code changes.

- Finding executable statements has been rewritten so that docstrings and
  other quirks of Python execution aren't mistakenly identified as missing
  lines.

- Lines can be excluded from consideration, even entire suites of lines.

- The file system cache of covered lines can be disabled programmatically.

- Modernized the code.
