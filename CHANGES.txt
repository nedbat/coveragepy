------------------------------
Change history for Coverage.py
------------------------------

Version 3.5.1
-------------

- The number of partial branches reported on the HTML summary page was 
  different than the number reported on the individual file pages.  This is
  now fixed.
- for-else constructs are understood better, and don't cause erroneous partial
  branch warnings.  Fixes `issue 122`_.

.. _issue 122: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/122/for-else-always-reports-missing-branch


Version 3.5 --- 29 June 2011
----------------------------

- The HTML report hotkeys now behave slightly differently when the current
  chunk isn't visible at all:  a chunk on the screen will be selected,
  instead of the old behavior of jumping to the literal next chunk.
  The hotkeys now work in Google Chrome.  Thanks, Guido van Rossum.


Version 3.5b1 --- 5 June 2011
-----------------------------

- The HTML report now has hotkeys.  Try ``n``, ``s``, ``m``, ``x``, ``b``,
  ``p``, and ``c`` on the overview page to change the column sorting.
  On a file page, ``r``, ``m``, ``x``, and ``p`` toggle the run, missing,
  excluded, and partial line markings.  You can navigate the highlighted
  sections of code by using the ``j`` and ``k`` keys for next and previous.
  The ``1`` (one) key jumps to the first highlighted section in the file,
  and ``0`` (zero) scrolls to the top of the file.

- The ``--omit`` and ``--include`` switches now interpret their values more
  usefully.  If the value starts with a wildcard character, it is used as-is.
  If it does not, it is interpreted relative to the current directory.
  Closes `issue 121`_.

- Partial branch warnings can now be pragma'd away.  The configuration option
  ``partial_branches`` is a list of regular expressions.  Lines matching any of
  those expressions will never be marked as a partial branch.  In addition,
  there's a built-in list of regular expressions marking statements which should
  never be marked as partial.  This list includes ``while True:``, ``while 1:``,
  ``if 1:``, and ``if 0:``.

- The ``coverage()`` constructor accepts single strings for the ``omit=`` and
  ``include=`` arguments, adapting to a common error in programmatic use.

- Modules can now be run directly using ``coverage run -m modulename``, to
  mirror Python's ``-m`` flag.  Closes `issue 95`_, thanks, Brandon Rhodes.

- ``coverage run`` didn't emulate Python accurately in one small detail: the
  current directory inserted into ``sys.path`` was relative rather than
  absolute. This is now fixed.

- HTML reporting is now incremental: a record is kept of the data that
  produced the HTML reports, and only files whose data has changed will
  be generated.  This should make most HTML reporting faster.

- Pathological code execution could disable the trace function behind our
  backs, leading to incorrect code measurement.  Now if this happens,
  coverage.py will issue a warning, at least alerting you to the problem.
  Closes `issue 93`_.  Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the idea.

- The C-based trace function now behaves properly when saved and restored
  with ``sys.gettrace()`` and ``sys.settrace()``.  This fixes `issue 125`_
  and `issue 123`_.  Thanks, Devin Jeanpierre.

- Source files are now opened with Python 3.2's ``tokenize.open()`` where
  possible, to get the best handling of Python source files with encodings.
  Closes `issue 107`_, thanks, Brett Cannon.

- Syntax errors in supposed Python files can now be ignored during reporting
  with the ``-i`` switch just like other source errors.  Closes `issue 115`_.

- Installation from source now succeeds on machines without a C compiler,
  closing `issue 80`_.

- Coverage.py can now be run directly from a working tree by specifying
  the directory name to python:  ``python coverage_py_working_dir run ...``.
  Thanks, Brett Cannon.

- A little bit of Jython support: `coverage run` can now measure Jython
  execution by adapting when $py.class files are traced. Thanks, Adi Roiban.
  Jython still doesn't provide the Python libraries needed to make
  coverage reporting work, unfortunately.

- Internally, files are now closed explicitly, fixing `issue 104`_.  Thanks,
  Brett Cannon.

Version 3.4 --- 19 September 2010
---------------------------------

- The XML report is now sorted by package name, fixing `issue 88`_.

- Programs that exited with ``sys.exit()`` with no argument weren't handled
  properly, producing a coverage.py stack trace.  That is now fixed.

.. _issue 88: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/88/xml-report-lists-packages-in-random-order


Version 3.4b2 --- 6 September 2010
----------------------------------

- Completely unexecuted files can now be included in coverage results, reported
  as 0% covered.  This only happens if the --source option is specified, since
  coverage.py needs guidance about where to look for source files.

- The XML report output now properly includes a percentage for branch coverage,
  fixing `issue 65`_ and `issue 81`_.

- Coverage percentages are now displayed uniformly across reporting methods.
  Previously, different reports could round percentages differently.  Also,
  percentages are only reported as 0% or 100% if they are truly 0 or 100, and
  are rounded otherwise.  Fixes `issue 41`_ and `issue 70`_.

- The precision of reported coverage percentages can be set with the
  ``[report] precision`` config file setting.  Completes `issue 16`_.

- Threads derived from ``threading.Thread`` with an overridden `run` method
  would report no coverage for the `run` method.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 85`_.

Version 3.4b1 --- 21 August 2010
--------------------------------

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the ``--omit`` and ``--include`` switches now take
  file patterns rather than file prefixes, closing `issue 34`_ and `issue 36`_.

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the `omit_prefixes` argument is gone throughout
  coverage.py, replaced with `omit`, a list of filename patterns suitable for
  `fnmatch`.  A parallel argument `include` controls what files are included.

- The run command now has a ``--source`` switch, a list of directories or
  module names.  If provided, coverage.py will only measure execution in those
  source files.

- Various warnings are printed to stderr for problems encountered during data
  measurement: if a ``--source`` module has no Python source to measure, or is
  never encountered at all, or if no data is collected.

- The reporting commands (report, annotate, html, and xml) now have an
  ``--include`` switch to restrict reporting to modules matching those file
  patterns, similar to the existing ``--omit`` switch. Thanks, Zooko.

- The run command now supports ``--include`` and ``--omit`` to control what
  modules it measures. This can speed execution and reduce the amount of data
  during reporting. Thanks Zooko.

- Since coverage.py 3.1, using the Python trace function has been slower than
  it needs to be.  A cache of tracing decisions was broken, but has now been
  fixed.

- Python 2.7 and 3.2 have introduced new opcodes that are now supported.

- Python files with no statements, for example, empty ``__init__.py`` files,
  are now reported as having zero statements instead of one.  Fixes `issue 1`_.

- Reports now have a column of missed line counts rather than executed line
  counts, since developers should focus on reducing the missed lines to zero,
  rather than increasing the executed lines to varying targets.  Once
  suggested, this seemed blindingly obvious.

- Line numbers in HTML source pages are clickable, linking directly to that
  line, which is highlighted on arrival.  Added a link back to the index page
  at the bottom of each HTML page.

- Programs that call ``os.fork`` will properly collect data from both the child
  and parent processes.  Use ``coverage run -p`` to get two data files that can
  be combined with ``coverage combine``.  Fixes `issue 56`_.

- Coverage is now runnable as a module: ``python -m coverage``.  Thanks,
  Brett Cannon.

- When measuring code running in a virtualenv, most of the system library was
  being measured when it shouldn't have been.  This is now fixed.

- Doctest text files are no longer recorded in the coverage data, since they
  can't be reported anyway.  Fixes `issue 52`_ and `issue 61`_.

- Jinja HTML templates compile into Python code using the HTML filename,
  which confused coverage.py.  Now these files are no longer traced, fixing
  `issue 82`.

- Source files can have more than one dot in them (foo.test.py), and will be
  treated properly while reporting.  Fixes `issue 46`_.

- Source files with DOS line endings are now properly tokenized for syntax
  coloring on non-DOS machines.  Fixes `issue 53`_.

- Unusual code structure that confused exits from methods with exits from
  classes is now properly analyzed.  See `issue 62`_.

- Asking for an HTML report with no files now shows a nice error message rather
  than a cryptic failure ('int' object is unsubscriptable). Fixes `issue 59`_.

Version 3.3.1 --- 6 March 2010
------------------------------

- Using `parallel=True` in .coveragerc file prevented reporting, but now does
  not, fixing `issue 49`_.

- When running your code with "coverage run", if you call `sys.exit()`,
  coverage.py will exit with that status code, fixing `issue 50`_.

.. _issue 49: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/49
.. _issue 50: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/50


Version 3.3 --- 24 February 2010
--------------------------------

- Settings are now read from a .coveragerc file.  A specific file can be
  specified on the command line with --rcfile=FILE.  The name of the file can
  be programmatically set with the `config_file` argument to the coverage()
  constructor, or reading a config file can be disabled with
  `config_file=False`.

- Fixed a problem with nested loops having their branch possibilities
  mischaracterized: `issue 39`_.

- Added coverage.process_start to enable coverage measurement when Python
  starts.

- Parallel data file names now have a random number appended to them in
  addition to the machine name and process id.

- Parallel data files combined with "coverage combine" are deleted after
  they're combined, to clean up unneeded files.  Fixes `issue 40`_.

- Exceptions thrown from product code run with "coverage run" are now displayed
  without internal coverage.py frames, so the output is the same as when the
  code is run without coverage.py.

- The `data_suffix` argument to the coverage constructor is now appended with
  an added dot rather than simply appended, so that .coveragerc files will not
  be confused for data files.

- Python source files that don't end with a newline can now be executed, fixing
  `issue 47`_.

- Added an AUTHORS.txt file.

.. _issue 47: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/47


Version 3.2 --- 5 December 2009
-------------------------------

- Added a ``--version`` option on the command line.


Version 3.2b4 --- 1 December 2009
---------------------------------

- Branch coverage improvements:

  - The XML report now includes branch information.

- Click-to-sort HTML report columns are now persisted in a cookie.  Viewing
  a report will sort it first the way you last had a coverage report sorted.
  Thanks, `Chris Adams`_.

- On Python 3.x, setuptools has been replaced by `Distribute`_.

.. _Distribute: http://packages.python.org/distribute/


Version 3.2b3 --- 23 November 2009
----------------------------------

- Fixed a memory leak in the C tracer that was introduced in 3.2b1.

- Branch coverage improvements:

  - Branches to excluded code are ignored.

- The table of contents in the HTML report is now sortable: click the headers
  on any column.  Thanks, `Chris Adams`_.

.. _Chris Adams: http://improbable.org/chris/


Version 3.2b2 --- 19 November 2009
----------------------------------

- Branch coverage improvements:

  - Classes are no longer incorrectly marked as branches: `issue 32`_.

  - "except" clauses with types are no longer incorrectly marked as branches:
    `issue 35`_.

- Fixed some problems syntax coloring sources with line continuations and
  source with tabs: `issue 30`_ and `issue 31`_.

- The --omit option now works much better than before, fixing `issue 14` and
  `issue 33`_.  Thanks, Danek Duvall.

Version 3.2b1 --- 10 November 2009
----------------------------------

- Branch coverage!

- XML reporting has file paths that let Cobertura find the source code.

- The tracer code has changed, it's a few percent faster.

- Some exceptions reported by the command line interface have been cleaned up
  so that tracebacks inside coverage.py aren't shown.  Fixes `issue 23`_.

.. _issue 23: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/23


Version 3.1 --- 4 October 2009
------------------------------

- Source code can now be read from eggs.  Thanks, Ross Lawley.  Fixes
  `issue 25`_.

.. _issue 25: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/25


Version 3.1b1 --- 27 September 2009
-----------------------------------

- Python 3.1 is now supported.

- Coverage.py has a new command line syntax with sub-commands.  This expands
  the possibilities for adding features and options in the future.  The old
  syntax is still supported.  Try "coverage help" to see the new commands.
  Thanks to Ben Finney for early help.

- Added an experimental "coverage xml" command for producing coverage reports
  in a Cobertura-compatible XML format.  Thanks, Bill Hart.

- Added the --timid option to enable a simpler slower trace function that works
  for DecoratorTools projects, including TurboGears.  Fixed `issue 12`_ and
  `issue 13`_.

- HTML reports show modules from other directories.  Fixed `issue 11`_.

- HTML reports now display syntax-colored Python source.

- Programs that change directory will still write .coverage files in the
  directory where execution started.  Fixed `issue 24`_.

- Added a "coverage debug" command for getting diagnostic information about the
  coverage.py installation.

.. _issue 24: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/24


Version 3.0.1 --- 7 July 2009
-----------------------------

- Removed the recursion limit in the tracer function.  Previously, code that
  ran more than 500 frames deep would crash. Fixed `issue 9`.

- Fixed a bizarre problem involving pyexpat, whereby lines following XML parser
  invocations could be overlooked.  Fixed `issue 10`.

- On Python 2.3, coverage.py could mis-measure code with exceptions being
  raised.  This is now fixed.

- The coverage.py code itself will now not be measured by coverage.py, and no
  coverage modules will be mentioned in the nose --with-cover plug-in.  Fixed
  `issue 8`.

- When running source files, coverage.py now opens them in universal newline
  mode just like Python does.  This lets it run Windows files on Mac, for
  example.

.. _issue 9: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/9
.. _issue 10: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/10
.. _issue 8: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/8


Version 3.0 --- 13 June 2009
----------------------------

- Fixed the way the Python library was ignored.  Too much code was being
  excluded the old way.

- Tabs are now properly converted in HTML reports.  Previously indentation was
  lost.  Fixed `issue 6`.

- Nested modules now get a proper flat_rootname.  Thanks, Christian Heimes.

.. _issue 6: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/6


Version 3.0b3 --- 16 May 2009
-----------------------------

- Added parameters to coverage.__init__ for options that had been set on the
  coverage object itself.

- Added clear_exclude() and get_exclude_list() methods for programmatic
  manipulation of the exclude regexes.

- Added coverage.load() to read previously-saved data from the data file.

- Improved the finding of code files.  For example, .pyc files that have been
  installed after compiling are now located correctly.  Thanks, Detlev
  Offenbach.

- When using the object API (that is, constructing a coverage() object), data
  is no longer saved automatically on process exit.  You can re-enable it with
  the auto_data=True parameter on the coverage() constructor. The module-level
  interface still uses automatic saving.


Version 3.0b --- 30 April 2009
------------------------------

HTML reporting, and continued refactoring.

- HTML reports and annotation of source files: use the new -b (browser) switch.
  Thanks to George Song for code, inspiration and guidance.

- Code in the Python standard library is not measured by default.  If you need
  to measure standard library code, use the -L command-line switch during
  execution, or the cover_pylib=True argument to the coverage() constructor.

- Source annotation into a directory (-a -d) behaves differently.  The
  annotated files are named with their hierarchy flattened so that same-named
  files from different directories no longer collide.  Also, only files in the
  current tree are included.

- coverage.annotate_file is no longer available.

- Programs executed with -x now behave more as they should, for example,
  __file__ has the correct value.

- .coverage data files have a new pickle-based format designed for better
  extensibility.

- Removed the undocumented cache_file argument to coverage.usecache().


Version 3.0b1 --- 7 March 2009
------------------------------

Major overhaul.

- Coverage is now a package rather than a module.  Functionality has been split
  into classes.

- The trace function is implemented in C for speed.  Coverage runs are now
  much faster.  Thanks to David Christian for productive micro-sprints and
  other encouragement.

- Executable lines are identified by reading the line number tables in the
  compiled code, removing a great deal of complicated analysis code.

- Precisely which lines are considered executable has changed in some cases.
  Therefore, your coverage stats may also change slightly.

- The singleton coverage object is only created if the module-level functions
  are used.  This maintains the old interface while allowing better
  programmatic use of Coverage.

- The minimum supported Python version is 2.3.


Version 2.85 --- 14 September 2008
----------------------------------

- Add support for finding source files in eggs. Don't check for
  morf's being instances of ModuleType, instead use duck typing so that
  pseudo-modules can participate. Thanks, Imri Goldberg.

- Use os.realpath as part of the fixing of file names so that symlinks won't
  confuse things. Thanks, Patrick Mezard.


Version 2.80 --- 25 May 2008
----------------------------

- Open files in rU mode to avoid line ending craziness. Thanks, Edward Loper.


Version 2.78 --- 30 September 2007
----------------------------------

- Don't try to predict whether a file is Python source based on the extension.
  Extension-less files are often Pythons scripts. Instead, simply parse the file
  and catch the syntax errors. Hat tip to Ben Finney.


Version 2.77 --- 29 July 2007
-----------------------------

- Better packaging.


Version 2.76 --- 23 July 2007
-----------------------------

- Now Python 2.5 is *really* fully supported: the body of the new with
  statement is counted as executable.


Version 2.75 --- 22 July 2007
-----------------------------

- Python 2.5 now fully supported. The method of dealing with multi-line
  statements is now less sensitive to the exact line that Python reports during
  execution. Pass statements are handled specially so that their disappearance
  during execution won't throw off the measurement.


Version 2.7 --- 21 July 2007
----------------------------

- "#pragma: nocover" is excluded by default.

- Properly ignore docstrings and other constant expressions that appear in the
  middle of a function, a problem reported by Tim Leslie.

- coverage.erase() shouldn't clobber the exclude regex. Change how parallel
  mode is invoked, and fix erase() so that it erases the cache when called
  programmatically.

- In reports, ignore code executed from strings, since we can't do anything
  useful with it anyway.

- Better file handling on Linux, thanks Guillaume Chazarain.

- Better shell support on Windows, thanks Noel O'Boyle.

- Python 2.2 support maintained, thanks Catherine Proulx.

- Minor changes to avoid lint warnings.


Version 2.6 --- 23 August 2006
------------------------------

- Applied Joseph Tate's patch for function decorators.

- Applied Sigve Tjora and Mark van der Wal's fixes for argument handling.

- Applied Geoff Bache's parallel mode patch.

- Refactorings to improve testability. Fixes to command-line logic for parallel
  mode and collect.


Version 2.5 --- 4 December 2005
-------------------------------

- Call threading.settrace so that all threads are measured. Thanks Martin
  Fuzzey.

- Add a file argument to report so that reports can be captured to a different
  destination.

- coverage.py can now measure itself.

- Adapted Greg Rogers' patch for using relative file names, and sorting and
  omitting files to report on.


Version 2.2 --- 31 December 2004
--------------------------------

- Allow for keyword arguments in the module global functions. Thanks, Allen.


Version 2.1 --- 14 December 2004
--------------------------------

- Return 'analysis' to its original behavior and add 'analysis2'. Add a global
  for 'annotate', and factor it, adding 'annotate_file'.


Version 2.0 --- 12 December 2004
--------------------------------

Significant code changes.

- Finding executable statements has been rewritten so that docstrings and
  other quirks of Python execution aren't mistakenly identified as missing
  lines.

- Lines can be excluded from consideration, even entire suites of lines.

- The file system cache of covered lines can be disabled programmatically.

- Modernized the code.
