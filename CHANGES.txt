CHANGE HISTORY for coverage.py
------------------------------

Version 3.0b2
-------------

Continued refactoring.

- coverage.annotate_file is no longer available.

- Programs executed with -x now behave more as they should, for example,
  __file__ has the correct value.


Version 3.0b1, 7 March 2009
---------------------------

Major overhaul.

- Coverage.py is now a package rather than a module, so the name is a bit of a
  misnomer, since there is no longer a file named coverage.py.  Functionality
  has been split into classes.

- The trace function is implemented in C for speed.

- Executable lines are identified by reading the line number tables in the
  compiled code, removing a great deal of complicated analysis code.
  
- The singleton coverage object is only created if the module-level functions
  are used.  This maintains the old interface while allowing better
  programmatic use of coverage.py.
  
- Minimum supported Python version is 2.3.

- Precisely which lines are considered executable has changed in some cases.
  Therefore, your coverage stats may also change.
  

Version 2.85, 14 September 2008
-------------------------------

- Add support for finding source files in eggs. Don't check for
  morf's being instances of ModuleType, instead use duck typing so that
  pseudo-modules can participate. Thanks, Imri Goldberg.
  
- Use os.realpath as part of the fixing of filenames so that symlinks won't
  confuse things. Thanks, Patrick Mezard.


Version 2.80, 25 May 2008
-------------------------

- Open files in rU mode to avoid line ending craziness. Thanks, Edward Loper.


Version 2.78, 30 September 2007
-------------------------------

- Don't try to predict whether a file is Python source based on the extension.
  Extensionless files are often Pythons scripts. Instead, simply parse the file
  and catch the syntax errors. Hat tip to Ben Finney.


Version 2.77, 29 July 2007
--------------------------

- Better packaging.


Version 2.76, 23 July 2007
--------------------------

- Now Python 2.5 is *really* fully supported: the body of the new with
  statement is counted as executable.


Version 2.75, 22 July 2007
--------------------------

- Python 2.5 now fully supported. The method of dealing with multi-line
  statements is now less sensitive to the exact line that Python reports during
  execution. Pass statements are handled specially so that their disappearance
  during execution won't throw off the measurement.


Version 2.7, 21 July 2007
-------------------------

- "#pragma: nocover" is excluded by default.

- Properly ignore docstrings and other constant expressions that appear in the
  middle of a function, a problem reported by Tim Leslie.

- coverage.erase() shouldn't clobber the exclude regex. Change how parallel
  mode is invoked, and fix erase() so that it erases the cache when called
  programmatically.

- In reports, ignore code executed from strings, since we can't do anything
  useful with it anyway.
  
- Better file handling on Linux, thanks Guillaume Chazarain.

- Better shell support on Windows, thanks Noel O'Boyle.

- Python 2.2 support maintained, thanks Catherine Proulx.

- Minor changes to avoid lint warnings.


Version 2.6, 23 August 2006
---------------------------

- Applied Joseph Tate's patch for function decorators.

- Applied Sigve Tjora and Mark van der Wal's fixes for argument handling.

- Applied Geoff Bache's parallel mode patch.

- Refactorings to improve testability. Fixes to command-line logic for parallel
  mode and collect.


Version 2.5, 4 December 2005
----------------------------

- Call threading.settrace so that all threads are measured. Thanks Martin
  Fuzzey.
  
- Add a file argument to report so that reports can be captured to a different
  destination.

- coverage.py can now measure itself.

- Adapted Greg Rogers' patch for using relative filenames, and sorting and
  omitting files to report on.


Version 2.2, 31 December 2004
-----------------------------

- Allow for keyword arguments in the module global functions. Thanks, Allen.


Version 2.1, 14 December 2004
-----------------------------

- Return 'analysis' to its original behavior and add 'analysis2'. Add a global
  for 'annotate', and factor it, adding 'annotate_file'.


Version 2.0, 12 December 2004
-----------------------------

Significant code changes.

- Finding executable statements has been rewritten so that docstrings and
  other quirks of Python execution aren't mistakenly identified as missing
  lines.

- Lines can be excluded from consideration, even entire suites of lines.

- The filesystem cache of covered lines can be disabled programmatically.

- Modernized the code.


Earlier History
---------------

2001-12-04 GDR Created.

2001-12-06 GDR Added command-line interface and source code annotation.

2001-12-09 GDR Moved design and interface to separate documents.

2001-12-10 GDR Open cache file as binary on Windows. Allow simultaneous -e and
-x, or -a and -r.

2001-12-12 GDR Added command-line help. Cache analysis so that it only needs to
be done once when you specify -a and -r.

2001-12-13 GDR Improved speed while recording. Portable between Python 1.5.2
and 2.1.1.

2002-01-03 GDR Module-level functions work correctly.

2002-01-07 GDR Update sys.path when running a file with the -x option, so that
it matches the value the program would get if it were run on its own.
