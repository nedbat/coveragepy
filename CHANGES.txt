------------------------------
Change history for Coverage.py
------------------------------

3.6.1
-----

- Improved the branch coverage mechanism, fixing `issue 175`_.

- Running code with ``coverage run -m`` now behaves more like Python does,
  setting sys.path properly, which fixes `issue 207`_ and `issue 242`_.

- Omitting files within a tree specified with the ``source`` option would
  cause them to be incorrectly marked as unexecuted, as described in
  `issue 218`_.  This is now fixed.

- When running a threaded program under the Python tracer, coverage would issue
  a spurious warning about the trace function changing: "Trace function
  changed, measurement is likely wrong: None." This is now fixed.

Version 3.6 --- 5 January 2013
------------------------------

- Added a page to the docs about troublesome situations, closing `issue 226`_,
  and added some info to the TODO file, closing `issue 227`_.

.. _issue 226: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/226/make-readme-section-to-describe-when
.. _issue 227: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/227/update-todo


Version 3.6b3 --- 29 December 2012
----------------------------------

- Beta 2 broke the nose plugin. It's fixed again, closing `issue 224`_.

.. _issue 224: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/224/36b2-breaks-nosexcover


Version 3.6b2 --- 23 December 2012
----------------------------------

- Coverage.py runs on Python 2.3 and 2.4 again. It was broken in 3.6b1.

- The C extension is optionally compiled using a different more widely-used
  technique, taking another stab at fixing `issue 80`_ once and for all.

- Combining data files would create entries for phantom files if used with
  ``source`` and path aliases.  It no longer does.

- ``debug sys`` now shows the configuration file path that was read.

- If an oddly-behaved package claims that code came from an empty-string
  filename, coverage.py no longer associates it with the directory name,
  fixing `issue 221`_.

.. _issue 221: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/221/coveragepy-incompatible-with-pyratemp


Version 3.6b1 --- 28 November 2012
----------------------------------

- Wildcards in ``include=`` and ``omit=`` arguments were not handled properly
  in reporting functions, though they were when running.  Now they are handled
  uniformly, closing `issue 143`_ and `issue 163`_.  **NOTE**: it is possible
  that your configurations may now be incorrect.  If you use ``include`` or
  ``omit`` during reporting, whether on the command line, through the API, or
  in a configuration file, please check carefully that you were not relying on
  the old broken behavior.

- The **report**, **html**, and **xml** commands now accept a ``--fail-under``
  switch that indicates in the exit status whether the coverage percentage was
  less than a particular value.  Closes `issue 139`_.

- The reporting functions coverage.report(), coverage.html_report(), and
  coverage.xml_report() now all return a float, the total percentage covered
  measurement.

- The HTML report's title can now be set in the configuration file, with the
  ``--title`` switch on the command line, or via the API.

- Configuration files now support substitution of environment variables, using
  syntax like ``${WORD}``.  Closes `issue 97`_.

- Embarrassingly, the `[xml] output=` setting in the .coveragerc file simply
  didn't work.  Now it does.

- The XML report now consistently uses filenames for the filename attribute,
  rather than sometimes using module names.  Fixes `issue 67`_.
  Thanks, Marcus Cobden.

- Coverage percentage metrics are now computed slightly differently under
  branch coverage.  This means that completely unexecuted files will now
  correctly have 0% coverage, fixing `issue 156`_.  This also means that your
  total coverage numbers will generally now be lower if you are measuring
  branch coverage.

- When installing, now in addition to creating a "coverage" command, two new
  aliases are also installed.  A "coverage2" or "coverage3" command will be
  created, depending on whether you are installing in Python 2.x or 3.x.
  A "coverage-X.Y" command will also be created corresponding to your specific
  version of Python.  Closes `issue 111`_.

- The coverage.py installer no longer tries to bootstrap setuptools or
  Distribute.  You must have one of them installed first, as `issue 202`_
  recommended.

- The coverage.py kit now includes docs (closing `issue 137`_) and tests.

- On Windows, files are now reported in their correct case, fixing `issue 89`_
  and `issue 203`_.

- If a file is missing during reporting, the path shown in the error message
  is now correct, rather than an incorrect path in the current directory.
  Fixes `issue 60`_.

- Running an HTML report in Python 3 in the same directory as an old Python 2
  HTML report would fail with a UnicodeDecodeError. This issue (`issue 193`_)
  is now fixed.

- Fixed yet another error trying to parse non-Python files as Python, this
  time an IndentationError, closing `issue 82`_ for the fourth time...

- If `coverage xml` fails because there is no data to report, it used to
  create a zero-length XML file.  Now it doesn't, fixing `issue 210`_.

- Jython files now work with the ``--source`` option, fixing `issue 100`_.

- Running coverage under a debugger is unlikely to work, but it shouldn't fail
  with "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable".  Fixes `issue 201`_.

- On some Linux distributions, when installed with the OS package manager,
  coverage.py would report its own code as part of the results.  Now it won't,
  fixing `issue 214`_, though this will take some time to be repackaged by the
  operating systems.

- Docstrings for the legacy singleton methods are more helpful.  Thanks Marius
  Gedminas.  Closes `issue 205`_.

- The pydoc tool can now show docmentation for the class `coverage.coverage`.
  Closes `issue 206`_.

- Added a page to the docs about contributing to coverage.py, closing
  `issue 171`_.

- When coverage.py ended unsuccessfully, it may have reported odd errors like
  ``'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isabs'``.  It no longer does,
  so kiss `issue 153`_ goodbye.

Version 3.5.3 --- 29 September 2012
-----------------------------------

- Line numbers in the HTML report line up better with the source lines, fixing
  `issue 197`_, thanks Marius Gedminas.

- When specifying a directory as the source= option, the directory itself no
  longer needs to have a ``__init__.py`` file, though its subdirectories do, to
  be considered as source files.

- Files encoded as UTF-8 with a BOM are now properly handled, fixing
  `issue 179`_.  Thanks, Pablo Carballo.

- Fixed more cases of non-Python files being reported as Python source, and
  then not being able to parse them as Python.  Closes `issue 82`_ (again).
  Thanks, Julian Berman.

- Fixed memory leaks under Python 3, thanks, Brett Cannon. Closes `issue 147`_.

- Optimized .pyo files may not have been handled correctly, `issue 195`_.
  Thanks, Marius Gedminas.

- Certain unusually named file paths could have been mangled during reporting,
  `issue 194`_.  Thanks, Marius Gedminas.

- Try to do a better job of the impossible task of detecting when we can't
  build the C extension, fixing `issue 183`_.

- Testing is now done with `tox`_, thanks, Marc Abramowitz.

Version 3.5.2 --- 4 May 2012
----------------------------

No changes since 3.5.2.b1


Version 3.5.2b1 --- 29 April 2012
---------------------------------

- The HTML report has slightly tweaked controls: the buttons at the top of
  the page are color-coded to the source lines they affect.

- Custom CSS can be applied to the HTML report by specifying a CSS file as
  the extra_css configuration value in the [html] section.

- Source files with custom encodings declared in a comment at the top are now
  properly handled during reporting on Python 2.  Python 3 always handled them
  properly.  This fixes `issue 157`_.

- Backup files left behind by editors are no longer collected by the source=
  option, fixing `issue 168`_.

- If a file doesn't parse properly as Python, we don't report it as an error
  if the filename seems like maybe it wasn't meant to be Python.  This is a
  pragmatic fix for `issue 82`_.

- The ``-m`` switch on ``coverage report``, which includes missing line numbers
  in the summary report, can now be specifed as ``show_missing`` in the
  config file.  Closes `issue 173`_.

- When running a module with ``coverage run -m <modulename>``, certain details
  of the execution environment weren't the same as for
  ``python -m <modulename>``.  This had the unfortunate side-effect of making
  ``coverage run -m unittest discover`` not work if you had tests in a
  directory named "test".  This fixes `issue 155`_ and `issue 142`_.

- Now the exit status of your product code is properly used as the process
  status when running ``python -m coverage run ...``.  Thanks, JT Olds.

- When installing into pypy, we no longer attempt (and fail) to compile
  the C tracer function, closing `issue 166`_.

.. _issue 173: https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/173/theres-no-way-to-specify-show-missing-in


Version 3.5.1 --- 23 September 2011
-----------------------------------

- The ``[paths]`` feature unfortunately didn't work in real world situations
  where you wanted to, you know, report on the combined data.  Now all paths
  stored in the combined file are canonicalized properly.


Version 3.5.1b1 --- 28 August 2011
----------------------------------

- When combining data files from parallel runs, you can now instruct coverage
  about which directories are equivalent on different machines.  A ``[paths]``
  section in the configuration file lists paths that are to be considered
  equivalent.  Finishes `issue 17`_.

- for-else constructs are understood better, and don't cause erroneous partial
  branch warnings.  Fixes `issue 122`_.

- Branch coverage for ``with`` statements is improved, fixing `issue 128`_.

- The number of partial branches reported on the HTML summary page was
  different than the number reported on the individual file pages.  This is
  now fixed.

- An explicit include directive to measure files in the Python installation
  wouldn't work because of the standard library exclusion.  Now the include
  directive takes precendence, and the files will be measured.  Fixes
  `issue 138`_.

- The HTML report now handles Unicode characters in Python source files
  properly.  This fixes `issue 124`_ and `issue 144`_. Thanks, Devin
  Jeanpierre.

- In order to help the core developers measure the test coverage of the
  standard library, Brandon Rhodes devised an aggressive hack to trick Python
  into running some coverage code before anything else in the process.
  See the coverage/fullcoverage directory if you are interested.

.. _issue 144: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/144/failure-generating-html-output-for


Version 3.5 --- 29 June 2011
----------------------------

- The HTML report hotkeys now behave slightly differently when the current
  chunk isn't visible at all:  a chunk on the screen will be selected,
  instead of the old behavior of jumping to the literal next chunk.
  The hotkeys now work in Google Chrome.  Thanks, Guido van Rossum.


Version 3.5b1 --- 5 June 2011
-----------------------------

- The HTML report now has hotkeys.  Try ``n``, ``s``, ``m``, ``x``, ``b``,
  ``p``, and ``c`` on the overview page to change the column sorting.
  On a file page, ``r``, ``m``, ``x``, and ``p`` toggle the run, missing,
  excluded, and partial line markings.  You can navigate the highlighted
  sections of code by using the ``j`` and ``k`` keys for next and previous.
  The ``1`` (one) key jumps to the first highlighted section in the file,
  and ``0`` (zero) scrolls to the top of the file.

- The ``--omit`` and ``--include`` switches now interpret their values more
  usefully.  If the value starts with a wildcard character, it is used as-is.
  If it does not, it is interpreted relative to the current directory.
  Closes `issue 121`_.

- Partial branch warnings can now be pragma'd away.  The configuration option
  ``partial_branches`` is a list of regular expressions.  Lines matching any of
  those expressions will never be marked as a partial branch.  In addition,
  there's a built-in list of regular expressions marking statements which should
  never be marked as partial.  This list includes ``while True:``, ``while 1:``,
  ``if 1:``, and ``if 0:``.

- The ``coverage()`` constructor accepts single strings for the ``omit=`` and
  ``include=`` arguments, adapting to a common error in programmatic use.

- Modules can now be run directly using ``coverage run -m modulename``, to
  mirror Python's ``-m`` flag.  Closes `issue 95`_, thanks, Brandon Rhodes.

- ``coverage run`` didn't emulate Python accurately in one small detail: the
  current directory inserted into ``sys.path`` was relative rather than
  absolute. This is now fixed.

- HTML reporting is now incremental: a record is kept of the data that
  produced the HTML reports, and only files whose data has changed will
  be generated.  This should make most HTML reporting faster.

- Pathological code execution could disable the trace function behind our
  backs, leading to incorrect code measurement.  Now if this happens,
  coverage.py will issue a warning, at least alerting you to the problem.
  Closes `issue 93`_.  Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the idea.

- The C-based trace function now behaves properly when saved and restored
  with ``sys.gettrace()`` and ``sys.settrace()``.  This fixes `issue 125`_
  and `issue 123`_.  Thanks, Devin Jeanpierre.

- Source files are now opened with Python 3.2's ``tokenize.open()`` where
  possible, to get the best handling of Python source files with encodings.
  Closes `issue 107`_, thanks, Brett Cannon.

- Syntax errors in supposed Python files can now be ignored during reporting
  with the ``-i`` switch just like other source errors.  Closes `issue 115`_.

- Installation from source now succeeds on machines without a C compiler,
  closing `issue 80`_.

- Coverage.py can now be run directly from a working tree by specifying
  the directory name to python:  ``python coverage_py_working_dir run ...``.
  Thanks, Brett Cannon.

- A little bit of Jython support: `coverage run` can now measure Jython
  execution by adapting when $py.class files are traced. Thanks, Adi Roiban.
  Jython still doesn't provide the Python libraries needed to make
  coverage reporting work, unfortunately.

- Internally, files are now closed explicitly, fixing `issue 104`_.  Thanks,
  Brett Cannon.

Version 3.4 --- 19 September 2010
---------------------------------

- The XML report is now sorted by package name, fixing `issue 88`_.

- Programs that exited with ``sys.exit()`` with no argument weren't handled
  properly, producing a coverage.py stack trace.  That is now fixed.

.. _issue 88: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/88/xml-report-lists-packages-in-random-order


Version 3.4b2 --- 6 September 2010
----------------------------------

- Completely unexecuted files can now be included in coverage results, reported
  as 0% covered.  This only happens if the --source option is specified, since
  coverage.py needs guidance about where to look for source files.

- The XML report output now properly includes a percentage for branch coverage,
  fixing `issue 65`_ and `issue 81`_.

- Coverage percentages are now displayed uniformly across reporting methods.
  Previously, different reports could round percentages differently.  Also,
  percentages are only reported as 0% or 100% if they are truly 0 or 100, and
  are rounded otherwise.  Fixes `issue 41`_ and `issue 70`_.

- The precision of reported coverage percentages can be set with the
  ``[report] precision`` config file setting.  Completes `issue 16`_.

- Threads derived from ``threading.Thread`` with an overridden `run` method
  would report no coverage for the `run` method.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 85`_.

Version 3.4b1 --- 21 August 2010
--------------------------------

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the ``--omit`` and ``--include`` switches now take
  file patterns rather than file prefixes, closing `issue 34`_ and `issue 36`_.

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the `omit_prefixes` argument is gone throughout
  coverage.py, replaced with `omit`, a list of filename patterns suitable for
  `fnmatch`.  A parallel argument `include` controls what files are included.

- The run command now has a ``--source`` switch, a list of directories or
  module names.  If provided, coverage.py will only measure execution in those
  source files.

- Various warnings are printed to stderr for problems encountered during data
  measurement: if a ``--source`` module has no Python source to measure, or is
  never encountered at all, or if no data is collected.

- The reporting commands (report, annotate, html, and xml) now have an
  ``--include`` switch to restrict reporting to modules matching those file
  patterns, similar to the existing ``--omit`` switch. Thanks, Zooko.

- The run command now supports ``--include`` and ``--omit`` to control what
  modules it measures. This can speed execution and reduce the amount of data
  during reporting. Thanks Zooko.

- Since coverage.py 3.1, using the Python trace function has been slower than
  it needs to be.  A cache of tracing decisions was broken, but has now been
  fixed.

- Python 2.7 and 3.2 have introduced new opcodes that are now supported.

- Python files with no statements, for example, empty ``__init__.py`` files,
  are now reported as having zero statements instead of one.  Fixes `issue 1`_.

- Reports now have a column of missed line counts rather than executed line
  counts, since developers should focus on reducing the missed lines to zero,
  rather than increasing the executed lines to varying targets.  Once
  suggested, this seemed blindingly obvious.

- Line numbers in HTML source pages are clickable, linking directly to that
  line, which is highlighted on arrival.  Added a link back to the index page
  at the bottom of each HTML page.

- Programs that call ``os.fork`` will properly collect data from both the child
  and parent processes.  Use ``coverage run -p`` to get two data files that can
  be combined with ``coverage combine``.  Fixes `issue 56`_.

- Coverage is now runnable as a module: ``python -m coverage``.  Thanks,
  Brett Cannon.

- When measuring code running in a virtualenv, most of the system library was
  being measured when it shouldn't have been.  This is now fixed.

- Doctest text files are no longer recorded in the coverage data, since they
  can't be reported anyway.  Fixes `issue 52`_ and `issue 61`_.

- Jinja HTML templates compile into Python code using the HTML filename,
  which confused coverage.py.  Now these files are no longer traced, fixing
  `issue 82`_.

- Source files can have more than one dot in them (foo.test.py), and will be
  treated properly while reporting.  Fixes `issue 46`_.

- Source files with DOS line endings are now properly tokenized for syntax
  coloring on non-DOS machines.  Fixes `issue 53`_.

- Unusual code structure that confused exits from methods with exits from
  classes is now properly analyzed.  See `issue 62`_.

- Asking for an HTML report with no files now shows a nice error message rather
  than a cryptic failure ('int' object is unsubscriptable). Fixes `issue 59`_.

Version 3.3.1 --- 6 March 2010
------------------------------

- Using `parallel=True` in .coveragerc file prevented reporting, but now does
  not, fixing `issue 49`_.

- When running your code with "coverage run", if you call `sys.exit()`,
  coverage.py will exit with that status code, fixing `issue 50`_.

.. _issue 49: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/49
.. _issue 50: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/50


Version 3.3 --- 24 February 2010
--------------------------------

- Settings are now read from a .coveragerc file.  A specific file can be
  specified on the command line with --rcfile=FILE.  The name of the file can
  be programmatically set with the `config_file` argument to the coverage()
  constructor, or reading a config file can be disabled with
  `config_file=False`.

- Fixed a problem with nested loops having their branch possibilities
  mischaracterized: `issue 39`_.

- Added coverage.process_start to enable coverage measurement when Python
  starts.

- Parallel data file names now have a random number appended to them in
  addition to the machine name and process id.

- Parallel data files combined with "coverage combine" are deleted after
  they're combined, to clean up unneeded files.  Fixes `issue 40`_.

- Exceptions thrown from product code run with "coverage run" are now displayed
  without internal coverage.py frames, so the output is the same as when the
  code is run without coverage.py.

- The `data_suffix` argument to the coverage constructor is now appended with
  an added dot rather than simply appended, so that .coveragerc files will not
  be confused for data files.

- Python source files that don't end with a newline can now be executed, fixing
  `issue 47`_.

- Added an AUTHORS.txt file.

Version 3.2 --- 5 December 2009
-------------------------------

- Added a ``--version`` option on the command line.


Version 3.2b4 --- 1 December 2009
---------------------------------

- Branch coverage improvements:

  - The XML report now includes branch information.

- Click-to-sort HTML report columns are now persisted in a cookie.  Viewing
  a report will sort it first the way you last had a coverage report sorted.
  Thanks, `Chris Adams`_.

- On Python 3.x, setuptools has been replaced by `Distribute`_.

.. _Distribute: http://packages.python.org/distribute/


Version 3.2b3 --- 23 November 2009
----------------------------------

- Fixed a memory leak in the C tracer that was introduced in 3.2b1.

- Branch coverage improvements:

  - Branches to excluded code are ignored.

- The table of contents in the HTML report is now sortable: click the headers
  on any column.  Thanks, `Chris Adams`_.

.. _Chris Adams: http://improbable.org/chris/


Version 3.2b2 --- 19 November 2009
----------------------------------

- Branch coverage improvements:

  - Classes are no longer incorrectly marked as branches: `issue 32`_.

  - "except" clauses with types are no longer incorrectly marked as branches:
    `issue 35`_.

- Fixed some problems syntax coloring sources with line continuations and
  source with tabs: `issue 30`_ and `issue 31`_.

- The --omit option now works much better than before, fixing `issue 14`_ and
  `issue 33`_.  Thanks, Danek Duvall.

Version 3.2b1 --- 10 November 2009
----------------------------------

- Branch coverage!

- XML reporting has file paths that let Cobertura find the source code.

- The tracer code has changed, it's a few percent faster.

- Some exceptions reported by the command line interface have been cleaned up
  so that tracebacks inside coverage.py aren't shown.  Fixes `issue 23`_.

.. _issue 23: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/23


Version 3.1 --- 4 October 2009
------------------------------

- Source code can now be read from eggs.  Thanks, Ross Lawley.  Fixes
  `issue 25`_.

.. _issue 25: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/25


Version 3.1b1 --- 27 September 2009
-----------------------------------

- Python 3.1 is now supported.

- Coverage.py has a new command line syntax with sub-commands.  This expands
  the possibilities for adding features and options in the future.  The old
  syntax is still supported.  Try "coverage help" to see the new commands.
  Thanks to Ben Finney for early help.

- Added an experimental "coverage xml" command for producing coverage reports
  in a Cobertura-compatible XML format.  Thanks, Bill Hart.

- Added the --timid option to enable a simpler slower trace function that works
  for DecoratorTools projects, including TurboGears.  Fixed `issue 12`_ and
  `issue 13`_.

- HTML reports show modules from other directories.  Fixed `issue 11`_.

- HTML reports now display syntax-colored Python source.

- Programs that change directory will still write .coverage files in the
  directory where execution started.  Fixed `issue 24`_.

- Added a "coverage debug" command for getting diagnostic information about the
  coverage.py installation.

.. _issue 24: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/24


Version 3.0.1 --- 7 July 2009
-----------------------------

- Removed the recursion limit in the tracer function.  Previously, code that
  ran more than 500 frames deep would crash. Fixed `issue 9`_.

- Fixed a bizarre problem involving pyexpat, whereby lines following XML parser
  invocations could be overlooked.  Fixed `issue 10`_.

- On Python 2.3, coverage.py could mis-measure code with exceptions being
  raised.  This is now fixed.

- The coverage.py code itself will now not be measured by coverage.py, and no
  coverage modules will be mentioned in the nose --with-cover plug-in.  Fixed
  `issue 8`_.

- When running source files, coverage.py now opens them in universal newline
  mode just like Python does.  This lets it run Windows files on Mac, for
  example.

.. _issue 10: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/10
.. _issue 8: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/8


Version 3.0 --- 13 June 2009
----------------------------

- Fixed the way the Python library was ignored.  Too much code was being
  excluded the old way.

- Tabs are now properly converted in HTML reports.  Previously indentation was
  lost.  Fixed `issue 6`_.

- Nested modules now get a proper flat_rootname.  Thanks, Christian Heimes.

.. _issue 6: http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/6


Version 3.0b3 --- 16 May 2009
-----------------------------

- Added parameters to coverage.__init__ for options that had been set on the
  coverage object itself.

- Added clear_exclude() and get_exclude_list() methods for programmatic
  manipulation of the exclude regexes.

- Added coverage.load() to read previously-saved data from the data file.

- Improved the finding of code files.  For example, .pyc files that have been
  installed after compiling are now located correctly.  Thanks, Detlev
  Offenbach.

- When using the object API (that is, constructing a coverage() object), data
  is no longer saved automatically on process exit.  You can re-enable it with
  the auto_data=True parameter on the coverage() constructor. The module-level
  interface still uses automatic saving.


Version 3.0b --- 30 April 2009
------------------------------

HTML reporting, and continued refactoring.

- HTML reports and annotation of source files: use the new -b (browser) switch.
  Thanks to George Song for code, inspiration and guidance.

- Code in the Python standard library is not measured by default.  If you need
  to measure standard library code, use the -L command-line switch during
  execution, or the cover_pylib=True argument to the coverage() constructor.

- Source annotation into a directory (-a -d) behaves differently.  The
  annotated files are named with their hierarchy flattened so that same-named
  files from different directories no longer collide.  Also, only files in the
  current tree are included.

- coverage.annotate_file is no longer available.

- Programs executed with -x now behave more as they should, for example,
  __file__ has the correct value.

- .coverage data files have a new pickle-based format designed for better
  extensibility.

- Removed the undocumented cache_file argument to coverage.usecache().


Version 3.0b1 --- 7 March 2009
------------------------------

Major overhaul.

- Coverage is now a package rather than a module.  Functionality has been split
  into classes.

- The trace function is implemented in C for speed.  Coverage runs are now
  much faster.  Thanks to David Christian for productive micro-sprints and
  other encouragement.

- Executable lines are identified by reading the line number tables in the
  compiled code, removing a great deal of complicated analysis code.

- Precisely which lines are considered executable has changed in some cases.
  Therefore, your coverage stats may also change slightly.

- The singleton coverage object is only created if the module-level functions
  are used.  This maintains the old interface while allowing better
  programmatic use of Coverage.

- The minimum supported Python version is 2.3.


Version 2.85 --- 14 September 2008
----------------------------------

- Add support for finding source files in eggs. Don't check for
  morf's being instances of ModuleType, instead use duck typing so that
  pseudo-modules can participate. Thanks, Imri Goldberg.

- Use os.realpath as part of the fixing of file names so that symlinks won't
  confuse things. Thanks, Patrick Mezard.


Version 2.80 --- 25 May 2008
----------------------------

- Open files in rU mode to avoid line ending craziness. Thanks, Edward Loper.


Version 2.78 --- 30 September 2007
----------------------------------

- Don't try to predict whether a file is Python source based on the extension.
  Extension-less files are often Pythons scripts. Instead, simply parse the file
  and catch the syntax errors. Hat tip to Ben Finney.


Version 2.77 --- 29 July 2007
-----------------------------

- Better packaging.


Version 2.76 --- 23 July 2007
-----------------------------

- Now Python 2.5 is *really* fully supported: the body of the new with
  statement is counted as executable.


Version 2.75 --- 22 July 2007
-----------------------------

- Python 2.5 now fully supported. The method of dealing with multi-line
  statements is now less sensitive to the exact line that Python reports during
  execution. Pass statements are handled specially so that their disappearance
  during execution won't throw off the measurement.


Version 2.7 --- 21 July 2007
----------------------------

- "#pragma: nocover" is excluded by default.

- Properly ignore docstrings and other constant expressions that appear in the
  middle of a function, a problem reported by Tim Leslie.

- coverage.erase() shouldn't clobber the exclude regex. Change how parallel
  mode is invoked, and fix erase() so that it erases the cache when called
  programmatically.

- In reports, ignore code executed from strings, since we can't do anything
  useful with it anyway.

- Better file handling on Linux, thanks Guillaume Chazarain.

- Better shell support on Windows, thanks Noel O'Boyle.

- Python 2.2 support maintained, thanks Catherine Proulx.

- Minor changes to avoid lint warnings.


Version 2.6 --- 23 August 2006
------------------------------

- Applied Joseph Tate's patch for function decorators.

- Applied Sigve Tjora and Mark van der Wal's fixes for argument handling.

- Applied Geoff Bache's parallel mode patch.

- Refactorings to improve testability. Fixes to command-line logic for parallel
  mode and collect.


Version 2.5 --- 4 December 2005
-------------------------------

- Call threading.settrace so that all threads are measured. Thanks Martin
  Fuzzey.

- Add a file argument to report so that reports can be captured to a different
  destination.

- coverage.py can now measure itself.

- Adapted Greg Rogers' patch for using relative file names, and sorting and
  omitting files to report on.


Version 2.2 --- 31 December 2004
--------------------------------

- Allow for keyword arguments in the module global functions. Thanks, Allen.


Version 2.1 --- 14 December 2004
--------------------------------

- Return 'analysis' to its original behavior and add 'analysis2'. Add a global
  for 'annotate', and factor it, adding 'annotate_file'.


Version 2.0 --- 12 December 2004
--------------------------------

Significant code changes.

- Finding executable statements has been rewritten so that docstrings and
  other quirks of Python execution aren't mistakenly identified as missing
  lines.

- Lines can be excluded from consideration, even entire suites of lines.

- The file system cache of covered lines can be disabled programmatically.

- Modernized the code.
