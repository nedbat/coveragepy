abstract: >-
  Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program,
  noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code
  that could have been executed but was not.
  Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It can show which
  parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are not.
