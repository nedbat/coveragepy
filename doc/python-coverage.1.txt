GLOBAL OPTIONS
==============

**--help**, **-h**
    Describe how to use coverage.py, in general or a command.

**--rcfile** `RCFILE`
    Specify configuration file `RCFILE`.  By default '.coveragerc',
    'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are tried.

**--debug** `DEBUGOPT`,...
    Debug options `DEBUGOPT`, separated by commas.



COMMAND REFERENCE
=================

**annotate** [ `option` ... ]

    Options:

    \-d `DIR`, --directory=`DIR`
        Write the output files to DIR.

    \--data-file `INFILE`
        Read coverage data for report generation from this
        file. Defaults to '.coverage'.

    \-i, --ignore-errors
        Ignore errors while reading source files.

    \--include `PATTERN` [ , ... ]
        Include only files whose paths match one of these
        PATTERNs. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.

        Usually needs quoting on the command line.

**combine** [ `option` ... ] [ `PATH` ... ]

    Combine data from multiple coverage files collected with ``run -p``.
    The combined results are written to a single file representing the

    coverage files are deleted.

    If `PATH` is specified, they are files or directories containing data to
    be combined.

    Options:

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

COVERAGE_FILE

    Path to the file where coverage measurements are collected to and
    reported from. Default: ``.coverage`` in the current working directory.

COVERAGE_RCFILE

    Path to the configuration file, often named ``.coveragerc``.

HISTORY
=======

The |command| command is a Python program which calls the ``coverage``
Python library to do all the work.

It was originally developed by Gareth Rees, and is now developed
by Ned Batchelder and many others.
