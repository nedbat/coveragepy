There are a number of projects that help integrate coverage.py into other
systems, provide help using it, offer assistance, and so on.

There's no guarantee these items are maintained or work well.  Some of them
seem to be quite old.  If you have suggestions for updates to this page, `open
a pull request`_ or `get in touch`_ some other way.

Test runners
------------

Helpers for using coverage with specific test runners.

* `pytest-cov`__ is a pytest plugin to coordinate coverage.py usage.

  __ https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/

* `trialcoverage`__ is a plug-in for Twisted trial.

  __ https://pypi.org/project/trialcoverage/


Configuration helpers
---------------------

Tools to provide more control over how coverage is configured.

* `covdefaults`__ provides "sensible" default settings for coverage.

  __ https://github.com/asottile/covdefaults

* `coverage-conditional-plugin`__ lets you use conditions instead of simple "no
  cover" pragmas to control what lines are considered under different
  conditions.

Language plugins
----------------

Coverage.py plugins to enable coverage measurement of other languages.

* `django-coverage-plugin`__ measures the coverage of Django templates.

  __ https://pypi.org/project/django-coverage-plugin/

* `Cython`__ provides a plugin for measuring Cythonized code.
