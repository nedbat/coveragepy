.. _cmd_annotate:

Text annotation: ``coverage annotate``
--------------------------------------

.. note::

    The **annotate** command has been obsoleted by more modern reporting tools,
    including the **html** command.  The command is still supported, but won't
    be getting new features.

The **annotate** command produces a text annotation of your source code.  With
a ``-d`` argument specifying an output directory, each Python file becomes a
text file in that directory.  Without ``-d``, the files are written into the
same directories as the original Python files.

Coverage status for each line of source is indicated with a character prefix::

    > executed
    ! missing (not executed)
    - excluded

For example::

      # A simple function, never called with x==1

    > def h(x):
          """Silly function."""
    -     if 0:  # pragma: no cover
    -         pass
    >     if x == 1:
    !         a = 1
    >     else:
    >         a = 2

    $ coverage annotate --help
    Usage: coverage annotate [options] [modules]

    Make annotated copies of the given files, marking statements that are executed
    with > and statements that are missed with !.

    Options:
      -d DIR, --directory=DIR
                            Write the output files to DIR.
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
