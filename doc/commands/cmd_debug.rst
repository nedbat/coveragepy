Diagnostics: ``coverage debug``
-------------------------------

The **debug** command shows internal information to help diagnose problems.
If you are reporting a bug about coverage.py, including the output of this
command can often help::

    $ coverage debug sys > please_attach_to_bug_report.txt

A few types of information are available:

* ``config``: show coverage's configuration
* ``sys``: show system configuration
* ``data``: show a summary of the collected coverage data
* ``premain``: show the call stack invoking coverage
* ``pybehave``: show internal flags describing Python behavior
* ``sqlite``: show internal compilation options for SQLite

.. [[[cog show_help("debug") ]]]
.. code::

    $ coverage debug --help
    Usage: coverage debug <topic>

    Display information about the internals of coverage.py, for diagnosing
    problems. Topics are: 'data' to show a summary of the collected data; 'sys' to
    show installation information; 'config' to show the configuration; 'premain'
    to show what is calling coverage; 'pybehave' to show internal flags describing
    Python behavior; 'sqlite' to show SQLite compilation options.

    Options:
      --debug=OPTS     Debug options, separated by commas. [env: COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help       Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE  Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                       'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are tried.
                       [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

.. _cmd_run_debug:

``--debug`` option
..................

The ``--debug`` option is available on all commands.  It instructs
coverage.py to log internal details of its operation to help with diagnosing
problems.  It takes a comma-separated list of options, each indicating a facet
of activity to log:

* ``callers``: annotate each debug message with a stack trace of the callers
  to that point.

* ``config``: before starting, dump all the :ref:`configuration <config>`
  values.

* ``dataio``: log when reading or writing any data file.

* ``dataop``: log a summary of data being added to CoverageData objects.

* ``dataop2``: when used with ``debug=dataop``, log the actual data being added
  to CoverageData objects.

* ``lock``: log operations acquiring locks in the data layer.

* ``multiproc``: log the start and stop of multiprocessing processes.

* ``patch``: log when patches are applied and when they are executed. See
  :ref:`config_run_patch`.

* ``pathmap``: log the remapping of paths that happens during ``coverage
  combine``. See :ref:`config_paths`.

* ``pid``: annotate all warnings and debug output with the process and thread
  ids.

* ``plugin``: print information about plugin operations.

* ``process``: show process creation information, and changes in the current
  directory.  This also writes a time stamp and command arguments into the data
  file.

* ``pybehave``: show the values of `internal flags <env.py_>`_ describing the
  behavior of the current version of Python.

* ``pytest``: indicate the name of the current pytest test when it changes.

* ``self``: annotate each debug message with the object printing the message.

* ``sql``: log the SQL statements used for recording data.

* ``sqldata``: when used with ``debug=sql``, also log the full data being used
  in SQL statements.

* ``sys``: before starting, dump all the system and environment information,
  as with :ref:`coverage debug sys <cmd_debug>`.

* ``trace``: print every decision about whether to trace a file or not. For
  files not being traced, the reason is also given.

.. _env.py: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/coverage/env.py

Debug options can also be set with the ``COVERAGE_DEBUG`` environment variable,
a comma-separated list of these options, or in the :ref:`config_run_debug`
section of the .coveragerc file.

The debug output goes to stderr, unless the :ref:`config_run_debug_file`
setting or the ``COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE`` environment variable names a different
file, which will be appended to.  This can be useful because many test runners
capture output, which could hide important details.  ``COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE``
accepts the special names ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to write to those
destinations.
