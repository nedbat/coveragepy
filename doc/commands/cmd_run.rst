.. _cmd_run:

Execution: ``coverage run``
---------------------------

You collect execution data by running your Python program with the **run**
command::

    $ coverage run my_program.py arg1 arg2
    blah blah ..your program's output.. blah blah

Your program runs just as if it had been invoked with the Python command line.
Arguments after your file name are passed to your program as usual in
``sys.argv``.  Rather than providing a file name, you can use the ``-m`` switch
and specify an importable module name instead, just as you can with the
Python ``-m`` switch::

    $ coverage run -m packagename.modulename arg1 arg2
    blah blah ..your program's output.. blah blah

.. note::

    In most cases, the program to use here is a test runner, not your program
    you are trying to measure. The test runner will run your tests and coverage
    will measure the coverage of your code along the way.

There are many options:

.. [[[cog show_help("run") ]]]
.. code::

    $ coverage run --help
    Usage: coverage run [options] <pyfile> [program options]

    Run a Python program, measuring code execution.

    Options:
      -a, --append          Append data to the data file. Otherwise it starts
                            clean each time.
      --branch              Measure branch coverage in addition to statement
                            coverage.
      --concurrency=LIBS    Properly measure code using a concurrency library.
                            Valid values are: eventlet, gevent, greenlet,
                            multiprocessing, thread, or a comma-list of them.
      --context=LABEL       The context label to record for this coverage run.
      --data-file=OUTFILE   Write the recorded coverage data to this file.
                            Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      -m, --module          <pyfile> is an importable Python module, not a script
                            path, to be run as 'python -m' would run it.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      -L, --pylib           Measure coverage even inside the Python installed
                            library, which isn't done by default.
      -p, --parallel-mode   Append a unique suffix to the data file name to
                            collect separate data from multiple processes.
      --save-signal=SIGNAL  Specify a signal that will trigger coverage to write
                            its collected data. Supported values are: USR1, USR2.
                            Not available on Windows.
      --source=SRC1,SRC2,...
                            A list of directories or importable names of code to
                            measure.
      --timid               Use the slower Python trace function core.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
.. [[[end]]] (sum: YwMI03MDmQ)

Many of these options can also be set in the :ref:`config_run` section of your
configuration file.  Remember to put options for run after "run", but before
the program invocation::

    $ coverage run --source=dir1,dir2 my_program.py arg1 arg2
    $ coverage run --source=dir1,dir2 -m packagename.modulename arg1 arg2

If you want :ref:`branch coverage <branch>` measurement, use the ``--branch``
flag.  Otherwise only statement coverage is measured.

You can specify the code to measure with the ``--source``, ``--include``, and
``--omit`` switches.  See :ref:`Specifying source files <source_execution>` for
details of their interpretation.

.. note::

    Specifying ``--source`` on the ``coverage run`` command line won't affect
    subsequent reporting commands like ``coverage xml``.  Use the :ref:`source
    <config_run_source>` setting in the configuration file to apply the setting
    uniformly to all commands.

Coverage.py can measure multi-threaded programs by default. If you are using
more other concurrency support, with the `multiprocessing`_, `greenlet`_,
`eventlet`_, or `gevent`_ libraries, then coverage.py can get confused. Use the
``--concurrency`` switch to properly measure programs using these libraries.
Give it a value of ``multiprocessing``, ``thread``, ``greenlet``, ``eventlet``,
or ``gevent``.  Values other than ``thread`` require the :ref:`C extension
<install_extension>`.

You can combine multiple values for ``--concurrency``, separated with commas.
You can specify ``thread`` and also one of ``eventlet``, ``gevent``, or
``greenlet``.

If you are using ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``, you must set your other
options in the configuration file.  Options on the command line will not be
passed to the processes that multiprocessing creates.  Best practice is to use
the configuration file for all options.

.. _multiprocessing: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html
.. _greenlet: https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/
.. _gevent: https://www.gevent.org/
.. _eventlet: https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/

If you are measuring coverage in a multi-process program, or across a number of
machines, you'll want the ``--parallel-mode`` switch to keep the data separate
during measurement.  See :ref:`cmd_combine` below.

You can specify a :ref:`static context <contexts>` for a coverage run with
``--context``.  This can be any label you want, and will be recorded with the
data.  See :ref:`contexts` for more information.

By default, coverage.py does not measure code installed with the Python
interpreter, for example, the standard library. If you want to measure that
code as well as your own, add the ``-L`` (or ``--pylib``) flag.

If your coverage results seem to be overlooking code that you know has been
executed, try running coverage.py again with the ``--timid`` flag.  This uses a
simpler but slower trace method, and might be needed in rare cases.

If you are specifying ``--save-signal``, please make sure that your program
doesn't intercept this signal. If it does, coverage won't receive the signal
and the data file will not be written.

.. versionadded:: 7.10 ``--save-signal``

Coverage.py sets an environment variable, ``COVERAGE_RUN`` to indicate that
your code is running under coverage measurement.  The value is not relevant,
and may change in the future.


.. _cmd_datafile:

Data file
.........

Coverage.py collects execution data in a file called ".coverage".  If need be,
you can set a new file name with the ``COVERAGE_FILE`` environment variable.
This can include a path to another directory.

By default, each run of your program starts with an empty data set. If you need
to run your program multiple times to get complete data (for example, because
you need to supply different options), you can accumulate data across runs with
the ``--append`` flag on the **run** command.
