.. [[[cog show_help("json") ]]]
.. code::

    $ coverage json --help
    Usage: coverage json [options] [modules]

    Generate a JSON report of coverage results.

    Options:
      --contexts=REGEX1,REGEX2,...
                            Only display data from lines covered in the given
                            contexts. Accepts Python regexes, which must be
                            quoted.
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --fail-under=MIN      Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less
                            than MIN.
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      -o OUTFILE            Write the JSON report to this file. Defaults to
                            'coverage.json'
      --pretty-print        Format the JSON for human readers.
      -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
      --show-contexts       Show contexts for covered lines.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
.. [[[end]]] (sum: 5T5gy2XZcc)

You can specify the name of the output file with the ``-o`` switch.  The JSON
can be nicely formatted by specifying the ``--pretty-print`` switch.

Other common reporting options are described above in :ref:`cmd_reporting`.
These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See
:ref:`Configuration: [json] <config_json>`.
