Erase data: ``coverage erase``
------------------------------

To erase the collected data, use the **erase** command:

.. [[[cog show_help("erase") ]]]
.. code::

    $ coverage erase --help
    Usage: coverage erase [options]

    Erase previously collected coverage data.

    Options:
      --data-file=DATAFILE  Base name of the data files to operate on. Defaults to
                            '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
.. [[[end]]] (sum: z+rvZs6NUV)

If your configuration file indicates parallel data collection, **erase** will
remove all of the data files.
