XML reporting: ``coverage xml``
-------------------------------

The **xml** command writes coverage data to a "coverage.xml" file in a format
compatible with `Cobertura`_.

.. _Cobertura: http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/

.. [[[cog show_help("xml") ]]]
.. code::

    $ coverage xml --help
    Usage: coverage xml [options] [modules]

    Generate an XML report of coverage results.

    Options:
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --fail-under=MIN      Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less
                            than MIN.
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      -o OUTFILE            Write the XML report to this file. Defaults to
                            'coverage.xml'
      -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
      --skip-empty          Skip files with no code.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
.. [[[end]]] (sum: iyOdiVNL4L)

You can specify the name of the output file with the ``-o`` switch.

Other common reporting options are described above in :ref:`cmd_reporting`.

To include complete file paths in the output file, rather than just
the file name, use [include] vs [source] in your ".coveragerc" file.

For example, use this:

.. code:: ini

    [run]
    include =
        foo/*
        bar/*


which will result in

.. code:: xml

    <class filename="bar/hello.py">
    <class filename="bar/baz/hello.py">
    <class filename="foo/hello.py">

in place of this:

.. code:: ini

    [run]
    source =
        foo
        bar

which may result in

.. code:: xml

    <class filename="hello.py">
    <class filename="baz/hello.py">

These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See
:ref:`Configuration: [xml] <config_xml>`.
