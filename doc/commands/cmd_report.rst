Coverage summary: ``coverage report``
-------------------------------------

The simplest reporting is a textual summary produced with **report**::

    $ coverage report
    Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ---------------------------------------------
    my_program.py                20      4    80%
    my_module.py                 15      2    86%
    my_other_module.py           56      6    89%
    ---------------------------------------------
    TOTAL                        91     12    87%

For each module executed, the report shows the count of executable statements,
the number of those statements missed, and the resulting coverage, expressed
as a percentage.

    Usage: coverage report [options] [modules]

    Report coverage statistics on modules.

    Options:
      --contexts=REGEX1,REGEX2,...
                            Only display data from lines covered in the given
                            contexts. Accepts Python regexes, which must be
                            quoted.
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --fail-under=MIN      Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less
                            than MIN.
      --format=FORMAT       Output format, either text (default), markdown, or
                            total.
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      --precision=N         Number of digits after the decimal point to display
                            for reported coverage percentages.
      --sort=COLUMN         Sort the report by the named column: name, stmts,
                            miss, branch, brpart, or cover. Default is name.
      -m, --show-missing    Show line numbers of statements in each module that
                            weren't executed.
      --skip-covered        Skip files with 100% coverage.
      --no-skip-covered     Disable --skip-covered.
      --skip-empty          Skip files with no code.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]
.. [[[end]]] (sum: FnJyop2efr)

The ``-m`` flag also shows the line numbers of missing statements::

    $ coverage report -m
    Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
    -------------------------------------------------------
    my_program.py                20      4    80%   33-35, 39
    my_module.py                 15      2    86%   8, 12
    my_other_module.py           56      6    89%   17-23
    -------------------------------------------------------
    TOTAL                        91     12    87%

If you are using branch coverage, then branch statistics will be reported in
the Branch and BrPart (for Partial Branch) columns, the Missing column will
detail the missed branches::

    $ coverage report -m
    Name                      Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover   Missing
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    my_program.py                20      4     10      2    80%   33-35, 36->38, 39
    my_module.py                 15      2      3      0    86%   8, 12
    my_other_module.py           56      6      5      1    89%   17-23, 40->45
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    TOTAL                        91     12     18      3    87%

Ranges of lines are shown with a dash: "17-23" means all lines from 17 to 23
inclusive are missing coverage.  Missed branches are shown with an arrow:
"40->45" means the branch from line 40 to line 45 is missing.  A branch can go
backwards in a file, so you might see a branch from a later line to an earlier
line, like "55->50".

You can restrict the report to only certain files by naming them on the
command line::

    $ coverage report -m my_program.py my_other_module.py
    Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
    -------------------------------------------------------
    my_program.py                20      4    80%   33-35, 39
    my_other_module.py           56      6    89%   17-23
    -------------------------------------------------------
    TOTAL                        76     10    87%

The ``--skip-covered`` switch will skip any file with 100% coverage, letting
you focus on the files that still need attention. The ``--no-skip-covered``
option can be used if needed to see all the files.  The ``--skip-empty`` switch
will skip any file with no executable statements.

If you have :ref:`recorded contexts <contexts>`, the ``--contexts`` option lets
you choose which contexts to report on.  See :ref:`context_reporting` for
details.

The ``--precision`` option controls the number of digits displayed after the
decimal point in coverage percentages, defaulting to none.

The ``--sort`` option is the name of a column to sort the report by.

The ``--format`` option controls the style of the report.  ``--format=text``
creates plain text tables as shown above.  ``--format=markdown`` creates
Markdown tables.  ``--format=total`` writes out a single number, the total
coverage percentage as shown at the end of the tables, but without a percent
sign.

Other common reporting options are described above in :ref:`cmd_reporting`.
These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See
:ref:`Configuration: [report] <config_report>`.
