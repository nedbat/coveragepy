Change history for coverage.py
==============================

These changes are listed in decreasing version number order. Note this can be
different from a strict chronological order when there are two branches in
development at the same time, such as 4.5.x and 5.0.

See :ref:`migrating` for significant changes that might be required when
upgrading your version of coverage.py.

    .. When updating the "Unreleased" header to a specific version, use this
    .. format.  Don't forget the jump target:

    ..
    ..  Version 9.8.1 — 2027-07-27
    ..  --------------------------

Unreleased
----------

- If you attempt to combine statement coverage data with branch coverage data,
  coverage.py used to fail with the message "Can't combine arc data with line
  data" or its reverse, "Can't combine line data with arc data."  These
  messages used internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand
  the problem.  They are now changed to mention "branch coverage data" and
  "statement coverage data."

- Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of Python.  I'm not
  claiming full support yet.

Version 7.5.3 — 2024-05-28
--------------------------

- Performance improvements for combining data files, especially when measuring
  line coverage. A few different quadratic behaviors were eliminated. In one
  extreme case of combining 700+ data files, the time dropped from more than
  three hours to seven minutes.  Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the fix.

- Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a side benefit of
  reducing memory use, closing `issue 1791`_.  Thanks to Daniel Diniz for
  helping to diagnose the problem.

.. _issue 1791: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1791


.. _changes_7-5-2:

Version 7.5.2 — 2024-05-24
--------------------------

- Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too much code, as
  reported in `issue 1779`_.  This is now fixed.

- Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module docstring to be an
  executable statement if it appeared after line 1 in the file, but not
  executable if it was the first line.  Now module docstrings are never counted
  as executable statements.  This can change coverage.py's count of the number
  of statements in a file, which can slightly change the coverage percentage
  reported.

- In the HTML report, the filter term and "hide covered" checkbox settings are
  remembered between viewings, thanks to `Daniel Diniz <pull 1776_>`_.

- Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.

- Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre source files are
  handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz fuzzing, thanks to `Liam DeVoe
  <pull 1788_>`_. Closes `issue 1787`_.

.. _changes_7-5-1:

Version 7.5.1 — 2024-05-04
--------------------------

- Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement
  now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is
  on the first line. This closes `issue 754`_. The fix was contributed by
  `Daniel Diniz <pull 1773_>`_.

- Fix: very complex source files like `this one <resolvent_lookup_>`_ could
  cause a maximum recursion error when creating an HTML report.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 1774`_.

- HTML report improvements:

  - Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have
    hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of
    stale cached copies.

  - Missing branch coverage explanations that said "the condition was never
    false" now read "the condition was always true" because it's easier to
    understand.

  - Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index pages,
    fixing `issue 1766`_.  Thanks, `Daniel Diniz <pull 1768_>`_.


.. _resolvent_lookup: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/130950f3e6b3f97fcc17f4599ac08f70fdd2e9d4/sympy/polys/numberfields/resolvent_lookup.py

.. _changes_7-5-0:

Version 7.5.0 — 2024-04-23
--------------------------

- Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report.
  There are now three index pages which link to each other: files, functions,
  and classes.  Other reports don't yet have this information, but it will be
  added in the future where it makes sense.  Feedback gladly accepted!
  Finishes `issue 780`_.

- Other HTML report improvements:

  - There is now a "hide covered" checkbox to filter out 100% files, finishing
    `issue 1384`_.

  - The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer
    indications of the sorting.

  - The "previous file" shortcut key didn't work on the index page, but now it
    does, fixing `issue 1765`_.

- The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows
  absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren't taking effect,
  and is renamed from "attempted_config_files" to the more logical
  "config_files_attempted."

- Python 3.13.0a6 is supported.

.. _issue 1765: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1765


.. _changes_7-4-4:

Version 7.4.4 — 2024-03-14
--------------------------

- Fix: in some cases, even with ``[run] relative_files=True``, a data file
  could be created with absolute path names.  When combined with other relative
  data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would be made
  relative or not. If they weren't, then a file would be listed twice in
  reports, as detailed in `issue 1752`_.  This is now fixed: absolute file
  names are always made relative when combining.  Thanks to Bruno Rodrigues dos
  Santos for support.

- Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if the
  branch was missed.  It said the pattern never matched, when actually the
  branch is missed if the last case always matched.

- Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more accurately.

- Fix: the ``report:format`` setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a
  string.  Thanks, `Tanaydin Sirin <pull 1754_>`_.  It is also now documented
  on the :ref:`configuration page <config_report_format>`.

.. _issue 1752: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1752
.. _pull 1754: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1754


.. _changes_7-4-3:

Version 7.4.3 — 2024-02-23
--------------------------

- Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: "Set changed
  size during iteration." This is now fixed, closing `issue 1733`_.

.. _issue 1733: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1733


.. _changes_7-4-2:

Version 7.4.2 — 2024-02-20
--------------------------

- Fix: setting ``COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`` no longer errors on 3.11 and lower,
  thanks `Hugo van Kemenade <pull 1747_>`_.  It now issues a warning that
  sys.monitoring is not available and falls back to the default core instead.

.. _pull 1747: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1747


.. _changes_7-4-1:

Version 7.4.1 — 2024-01-26
--------------------------

- Python 3.13.0a3 is supported.

- Fix: the JSON report now includes an explicit format version number, closing
  `issue 1732`_.

.. _issue 1732: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1732


.. _changes_7-4-0:

Version 7.4.0 — 2023-12-27
--------------------------

- In Python 3.12 and above, you can try an experimental core based on the new
  :mod:`sys.monitoring <python:sys.monitoring>` module by defining a
  ``COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`` environment variable.  This should be faster for
  line coverage, but not for branch coverage, and plugins and dynamic contexts
  are not yet supported with it.  I am very interested to hear how it works (or
  doesn't!) for you.


.. _changes_7-3-4:

Version 7.3.4 — 2023-12-20
--------------------------

- Fix: the change for multi-line signature exclusions in 7.3.3 broke other
  forms of nested clauses being excluded properly.  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 1713`_.

- Fix: in the HTML report, selecting code for copying won't select the line
  numbers also. Thanks, `Robert Harris <pull 1717_>`_.

.. _issue 1713: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1713
.. _pull 1717: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1717


.. _changes_7-3-3:

Version 7.3.3 — 2023-12-14
--------------------------

- Fix: function definitions with multi-line signatures can now be excluded by
  matching any of the lines, closing `issue 684`_.  Thanks, `Jan Rusak,
  Maciej Kowalczyk and Joanna Ejzel <pull 1705_>`_.

- Fix: XML reports could fail with a TypeError if files had numeric components
  that were duplicates except for leading zeroes, like ``file1.py`` and
  ``file001.py``.  Fixes `issue 1709`_.

- The ``coverage annotate`` command used to announce that it would be removed
  in a future version. Enough people got in touch to say that they use it, so
  it will stay.  Don't expect it to keep up with other new features though.

- Added new :ref:`debug options <cmd_run_debug>`:

  - ``pytest`` writes the pytest test name into the debug output.

  - ``dataop2`` writes the full data being added to CoverageData objects.

.. _issue 684: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/684
.. _pull 1705: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1705
.. _issue 1709: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1709


.. _changes_7-3-2:

Version 7.3.2 — 2023-10-02
--------------------------

- The ``coverage lcov`` command ignored the ``[report] exclude_lines`` and
  ``[report] exclude_also`` settings (`issue 1684`_).  This is now fixed,
  thanks `Jacqueline Lee <pull 1685_>`_.

- Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the coverage.py database
  files.  These are ephemeral, but could be mistakenly included when combining
  data files.  Now they are always ignored, fixing `issue 1605`_. Thanks to
  Brad Smith for suggesting fixes and providing detailed debugging.

- On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files, which should be
  a little faster.

- The new 3.12 soft keyword ``type`` is properly bolded in HTML reports.

- Removed the "fullcoverage" feature used by CPython to measure the coverage of
  early-imported standard library modules.  CPython `stopped using it
  <88054_>`_ in 2021, and it stopped working completely in Python 3.13.

.. _issue 1684: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1684
.. _pull 1685: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1685
.. _88054: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88054


.. _changes_7-3-1:

Version 7.3.1 — 2023-09-06
--------------------------

- The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in the docs.  A
  leading or trailing star matches any number of path components, like a double
  star would.  This is different than the behavior of a star in the middle of a
  pattern.  This discrepancy was `identified by Sviatoslav Sydorenko
  <starbad_>`_, who `provided patient detailed diagnosis <pull 1650_>`_ and
  graciously agreed to a pragmatic resolution.

- The API docs were missing from the last version. They are now `restored
  <apidocs_>`_.

.. _apidocs: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_coverage.html
.. _starbad: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407#issuecomment-1631085209
.. _pull 1650: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1650

.. _changes_7-3-0:

Version 7.3.0 — 2023-08-12
--------------------------

- Added a :meth:`.Coverage.collect` context manager to start and stop coverage
  data collection.

- Dropped support for Python 3.7.

- Fix: in unusual circumstances, SQLite cannot be set to asynchronous mode.
  Coverage.py would fail with the error ``Safety level may not be changed
  inside a transaction.`` This is now avoided, closing `issue 1646`_.  Thanks
  to Michael Bell for the detailed bug report.

- Docs: examples of configuration files now include separate examples for the
  different syntaxes: .coveragerc, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, and tox.ini.

- Fix: added ``nosemgrep`` comments to our JavaScript code so that
  semgrep-based SAST security checks won't raise false alarms about security
  problems that aren't problems.

- Added a CITATION.cff file, thanks to `Ken Schackart <pull 1641_>`_.

.. _pull 1641: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1641
.. _issue 1646: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1646


.. _changes_7-2-7:

Version 7.2.7 — 2023-05-29
--------------------------

- Fix: reverted a `change from 6.4.3 <pull 1347b_>`_ that helped Cython, but
  also increased the size of data files when using dynamic contexts, as
  described in the now-fixed `issue 1586`_. The problem is now avoided due to a
  recent change (`issue 1538 <issue 1538b_>`_).  Thanks to `Anders Kaseorg
  <pull 1629_>`_ and David Szotten for persisting with problem reports and
  detailed diagnoses.

- Wheels are now provided for CPython 3.12.

.. _issue 1586: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1586
.. _pull 1629: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1629


.. _changes_7-2-6:

Version 7.2.6 — 2023-05-23
--------------------------

- Fix: the ``lcov`` command could raise an IndexError exception if a file is
  translated to Python but then executed under its own name.  Jinja2 does this
  when rendering templates.  Fixes `issue 1553`_.

- Python 3.12 beta 1 now inlines comprehensions.  Previously they were compiled
  as invisible functions and coverage.py would warn you if they weren't
  completely executed.  This no longer happens under Python 3.12.

- Fix: the ``coverage debug sys`` command includes some environment variables
  in its output.  This could have included sensitive data.  Those values are
  now hidden with asterisks, closing `issue 1628`_.

.. _issue 1553: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1553
.. _issue 1628: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1628


.. _changes_7-2-5:

Version 7.2.5 — 2023-04-30
--------------------------

- Fix: ``html_report()`` could fail with an AttributeError on ``isatty`` if run
  in an unusual environment where sys.stdout had been replaced.  This is now
  fixed.


.. _changes_7-2-4:

Version 7.2.4 — 2023-04-28
--------------------------

PyCon 2023 sprint fixes!

- Fix: with ``relative_files = true``, specifying a specific file to include or
  omit wouldn't work correctly (`issue 1604`_).  This is now fixed, with
  testing help by `Marc Gibbons <pull 1608_>`_.

- Fix: the XML report would have an incorrect ``<source>`` element when using
  relative files and the source option ended with a slash (`issue 1541`_).
  This is now fixed, thanks to `Kevin Brown-Silva <pull 1608_>`_.

- When the HTML report location is printed to the terminal, it's now a
  terminal-compatible URL, so that you can click the location to open the HTML
  file in your browser.  Finishes `issue 1523`_ thanks to `Ricardo Newbery
  <pull 1613_>`_.

- Docs: a new :ref:`Migrating page <migrating>` with details about how to
  migrate between major versions of coverage.py.  It currently covers the
  wildcard changes in 7.x.  Thanks, `Brian Grohe <pull 1610_>`_.

.. _changes_7-2-3:

Version 7.2.3 — 2023-04-06
--------------------------

- Fix: the :ref:`config_run_sigterm` setting was meant to capture data if a
  process was terminated with a SIGTERM signal, but it didn't always.  This was
  fixed thanks to `Lewis Gaul <pull 1600_>`_, closing `issue 1599`_.

- Performance: HTML reports with context information are now much more compact.
  File sizes are typically as small as one-third the previous size, but can be
  dramatically smaller. This closes `issue 1584`_ thanks to `Oleh Krehel
  <pull 1587_>`_.

- Development dependencies no longer use hashed pins, closing `issue 1592`_.

.. _changes_7-2-2:

Version 7.2.2 — 2023-03-16
--------------------------

- Fix: if a virtualenv was created inside a source directory, and a sourced
  package was installed inside the virtualenv, then all of the third-party
  packages inside the virtualenv would be measured.  This was incorrect, but
  has now been fixed: only the specified packages will be measured, thanks to
  `Manuel Jacob <pull 1560_>`_.

- Fix: the ``coverage lcov`` command could create a .lcov file with incorrect
  LF (lines found) and LH (lines hit) totals.  This is now fixed, thanks to
  `Ian Moore <pull 1583_>`_.

- Fix: the ``coverage xml`` command on Windows could create a .xml file with
  duplicate ``<package>`` elements. This is now fixed, thanks to `Benjamin
  Parzella <pull 1574_>`_, closing `issue 1573`_.

Version 7.2.1 — 2023-02-26
--------------------------

- Fix: the PyPI page had broken links to documentation pages, but no longer
  does, closing `issue 1566`_.

- Fix: public members of the coverage module are now properly indicated so that
  mypy will find them, fixing `issue 1564`_.

.. _issue 1564: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1564
.. _issue 1566: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1566


.. _changes_7-2-0:

Version 7.2.0 — 2023-02-22
--------------------------

- Added a new setting ``[report] exclude_also`` to let you add more exclusions
  without overwriting the defaults.  Thanks, `Alpha Chen <pull 1557_>`_,
  closing `issue 1391`_.

- Added a :meth:`.CoverageData.purge_files` method to remove recorded data for
  a particular file.  Contributed by `Stephan Deibel <pull 1547_>`_.

- Fix: when reporting commands fail, they will no longer congratulate
  themselves with messages like "Wrote XML report to file.xml" before spewing a
  traceback about their failure.

- Fix: arguments in the public API that name file paths now accept pathlib.Path
  objects.  This includes the ``data_file`` and ``config_file`` arguments to
  the Coverage constructor and the ``basename`` argument to CoverageData.
  Closes `issue 1552`_.

- Fix: In some embedded environments, an IndexError could occur on stop() when
  the originating thread exits before completion.  This is now fixed, thanks to
  `Russell Keith-Magee <pull 1543_>`_, closing `issue 1542`_.

- Added a ``py.typed`` file to announce our type-hintedness.  Thanks,
  `KotlinIsland <pull 1550_>`_.

Version 7.1.0 — 2023-01-24
--------------------------

- Added: the debug output file can now be specified with ``[run] debug_file``
  in the configuration file.  Closes `issue 1319`_.

- Performance: fixed a slowdown with dynamic contexts that's been around since
  6.4.3.  The fix closes `issue 1538`_.  Thankfully this doesn't break the
  `Cython change`_ that fixed `issue 972`_.  Thanks to Mathieu Kniewallner for
  the deep investigative work and comprehensive issue report.

- Typing: all product and test code has type annotations.

Version 7.0.5 — 2023-01-10
--------------------------

- Fix: On Python 3.7, a file with type annotations but no ``from __future__
  import annotations`` would be missing statements in the coverage report. This
  is now fixed, closing `issue 1524`_.

.. _issue 1524: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1524


.. _changes_7-0-4:

Version 7.0.4 — 2023-01-07
--------------------------

- Performance: an internal cache of file names was accidentally disabled,
  resulting in sometimes drastic reductions in performance.  This is now fixed,
  closing `issue 1527`_.   Thanks to Ivan Ciuvalschii for the reproducible test
  case.

.. _issue 1527: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1527


.. _changes_7-0-3:

Version 7.0.3 — 2023-01-03
--------------------------

- Fix: when using pytest-cov or pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining
  step could fail with ``assert row is not None`` using 7.0.2.  This was due to
  a race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In
  7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code.
  Now it will produce a message "Couldn't combine data file" and ignore the
  data file as it used to do before 7.0.2.  Closes `issue 1522`_.

.. _issue 1522: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522


.. _changes_7-0-2:

Version 7.0.2 — 2023-01-02
--------------------------

- Fix: when using the ``[run] relative_files = True`` setting, a relative
  ``[paths]`` pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,
  closing `issue 1519`_.

- Fix: if Python doesn't provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can
  only be read if coverage.py is installed with the ``[toml]`` extra.
  Coverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees
  your settings are in a .toml file. But it didn't understand that
  ``[tools.coverage]`` was a valid section header, so the error wasn't reported
  if you used that header, and settings were silently ignored.  This is now
  fixed, closing `issue 1516`_.

- Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing `issue 1515`_.

- Fix: the ``coverage lcov`` report did not properly implement the
  ``--fail-under=MIN`` option.  This has been fixed.

- Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings.
  This should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some
  places, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.

- Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and
  IronPython.

Version 7.0.1 — 2022-12-23
--------------------------

- When checking if a file mapping resolved to a file that exists, we weren't
  considering files in .whl files.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1511`_.

- File pattern rules were too strict, forbidding plus signs and curly braces in
  directory and file names.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1513`_.

- Unusual Unicode or control characters in source files could prevent
  reporting.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1512`_.

- The PyPy wheel now installs on PyPy 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, closing `issue 1510`_.

Version 7.0.0 — 2022-12-18
--------------------------

Nothing new beyond 7.0.0b1.

Version 7.0.0b1 — 2022-12-03
----------------------------

A number of changes have been made to file path handling, including pattern
matching and path remapping with the ``[paths]`` setting (see
:ref:`config_paths`).  These changes might affect you, and require you to
update your settings.

(This release includes the changes from `6.6.0b1`__, since 6.6.0 was never
released.)

__ https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-6-6-0b1

- Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your
  configuration:

  - Previously, ``*`` would incorrectly match directory separators, making
    precise matching difficult.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1407`_.

  - Now ``**`` matches any number of nested directories, including none.

- Improvements to combining data files when using the
  :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting, which might require updating your
  configuration:

  - During ``coverage combine``, relative file paths are implicitly combined
    without needing a ``[paths]`` configuration setting.  This also fixed
    `issue 991`_.

  - A ``[paths]`` setting like ``*/foo`` will now match ``foo/bar.py`` so that
    relative file paths can be combined more easily.

  - The :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting is properly interpreted in
    more places, fixing `issue 1280`_.

- When remapping file paths with ``[paths]``, a path will be remapped only if
  the resulting path exists.  The documentation has long said the prefix had to
  exist, but it was never enforced.  This fixes `issue 608`_, improves `issue
  649`_, and closes `issue 757`_.

- Reporting operations now implicitly use the ``[paths]`` setting to remap file
  paths within a single data file.  Combining multiple files still requires the
  ``coverage combine`` step, but this simplifies some single-file situations.
  Closes `issue 1212`_ and `issue 713`_.

- The ``coverage report`` command now has a ``--format=`` option.  The original
  style is now ``--format=text``, and is the default.

  - Using ``--format=markdown`` will write the table in Markdown format, thanks
    to `Steve Oswald <pull 1479_>`_, closing `issue 1418`_.

  - Using ``--format=total`` will write a single total number to the
    output.  This can be useful for making badges or writing status updates.

- Combining data files with ``coverage combine`` now hashes the data files to
  skip files that add no new information.  This can reduce the time needed.
  Many details affect the speed-up, but for coverage.py's own test suite,
  combining is about 40% faster. Closes `issue 1483`_.

- When searching for completely un-executed files, coverage.py uses the
  presence of ``__init__.py`` files to determine which directories have source
  that could have been imported.  However, `implicit namespace packages`_ don't
  require ``__init__.py``.  A new setting ``[report]
  include_namespace_packages`` tells coverage.py to consider these directories
  during reporting.  Thanks to `Felix Horvat <pull 1387_>`_ for the
  contribution.  Closes `issue 1383`_ and `issue 1024`_.

- Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files.  It was overly
  broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in `issue
  1481`_ and `issue 1345`_.  This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require
  changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment
  substitution.

- An empty file has a coverage total of 100%, but used to fail with
  ``--fail-under``.  This has been fixed, closing `issue 1470`_.

- The text report table no longer writes out two separator lines if there are
  no files listed in the table.  One is plenty.

- Fixed a mis-measurement of a strange use of wildcard alternatives in
  match/case statements, closing `issue 1421`_.

- Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on
  implementations other than CPython or PyPy (`issue 1474`_).

- The deprecated ``[run] note`` setting has been completely removed.

Version 6.6.0b1 — 2022-10-31
----------------------------

(Note: 6.6.0 final was never released. These changes are part of `7.0.0b1`__.)

Version 6.5.0 — 2022-09-29
--------------------------

- The JSON report now includes details of which branches were taken, and which
  are missing for each file. Thanks, `Christoph Blessing <pull 1438_>`_. Closes
  `issue 1425`_.

- Starting with coverage.py 6.2, ``class`` statements were marked as a branch.
  This wasn't right, and has been reverted, fixing `issue 1449`_. Note this
  will very slightly reduce your coverage total if you are measuring branch
  coverage.

- Packaging is now compliant with `PEP 517`_, closing `issue 1395`_.

- A new debug option ``--debug=pathmap`` shows details of the remapping of
  paths that happens during combine due to the ``[paths]`` setting.

- Fix an internal problem with caching of invalid Python parsing. Found by
  OSS-Fuzz, fixing their `bug 50381`_.

.. _changes_6-4-3:

Version 6.4.3 — 2022-08-06
--------------------------

- Fix a failure when combining data files if the file names contained glob-like
  patterns.  Thanks, `Michael Krebs and Benjamin Schubert <pull 1405_>`_.

- Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a different
  drive than the current directory, closing `issue 1428`_.  Thanks, `Lorenzo
  Micò <pull 1430_>`_.

- Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you might do in
  a Docker container. Thanks `Arthur Rio <pull 1403_>`_.

- Filtering in the HTML report wouldn't work when reloading the index page.
  This is now fixed.  Thanks, `Marc Legendre <pull 1413_>`_.

- Fix a problem with Cython code measurement, closing `issue 972`_.  Thanks,

.. _changes_6-4-2:

Version 6.4.2 — 2022-07-12
--------------------------

- Updated for a small change in Python 3.11.0 beta 4: modules now start with a
  line with line number 0, which is ignored.  This line cannot be executed, so
  coverage totals were thrown off.  This line is now ignored by coverage.py,
  but this also means that truly empty modules (like ``__init__.py``) have no
  lines in them, rather than one phantom line.  Fixes `issue 1419`_.

- Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to
  avoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules.  Thanks,
  `Yilei Yang <pull 1399_>`_.

.. _changes_6-4-1:

Version 6.4.1 — 2022-06-02
--------------------------

- Greatly improved performance on PyPy, and other environments that need the
  pure Python trace function.  Thanks, Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick (`pull
  1381`_ and `pull 1388`_).  Slightly improved performance when using the C
  trace function, as most environments do.  Closes `issue 1339`_.

- The conditions for using tomllib from the standard library have been made
  more precise, so that 3.11 alphas will continue to work. Closes `issue
  1390`_.

.. _changes_64:

Version 6.4 — 2022-05-22
------------------------

- A new setting, :ref:`config_run_sigterm`, controls whether a SIGTERM signal
  handler is used.  In 6.3, the signal handler was always installed, to capture
  data at unusual process ends.  Unfortunately, this introduced other problems
  (see `issue 1310`_).  Now the signal handler is only used if you opt-in by
  setting ``[run] sigterm = true``.

- Small changes to the HTML report:

  - Added links to next and previous file, and more keyboard shortcuts: ``[``
    and ``]`` for next file and previous file; ``u`` for up to the index; and
    ``?`` to open/close the help panel.  Thanks, `J. M. F. Tsang
    <pull 1364_>`_.

  - The time stamp and version are displayed at the top of the report.  Thanks,
    `Ammar Askar <pull 1354_>`_. Closes `issue 1351`_.

- A new debug option ``debug=sqldata`` adds more detail to ``debug=sql``,
  logging all the data being written to the database.

- Previously, running ``coverage report`` (or any of the reporting commands) in
  an empty directory would create a .coverage data file.  Now they do not,
  fixing `issue 1328`_.

- On Python 3.11, the ``[toml]`` extra no longer installs tomli, instead using
  tomllib from the standard library.  Thanks `Shantanu <pull 1359_>`_.

- In-memory CoverageData objects now properly update(), closing `issue 1323`_.

  Closes `issue 1367`_.  Some results for generators may have changed.

.. _issue 1367: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1367

Version 6.3.2 — 2022-02-20
--------------------------

- Fix: adapt to pypy3.9's decorator tracing behavior.  It now traces function
  decorators like CPython 3.8: both the @-line and the def-line are traced.
  Fixes `issue 1326`_.

- Debug: added ``pybehave`` to the list of :ref:`coverage debug <cmd_debug>`
  and :ref:`cmd_run_debug` options.

- Fix: show an intelligible error message if ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``
  is used without a configuration file.  Closes `issue 1320`_.

Version 6.3.1 — 2022-02-01
--------------------------

- Fix: deadlocks could occur when terminating processes.  Some of these
  deadlocks (described in `issue 1310`_) are now fixed.

- Fix: a signal handler was being set from multiple threads, causing an error:
  "ValueError: signal only works in main thread".  This is now fixed, closing
  `issue 1312`_.

- Fix: ``--precision`` on the command-line was being ignored while considering
  ``--fail-under``.  This is now fixed, thanks to
  `Marcelo Trylesinski <pull 1317_>`_.

- Fix: releases no longer provide 3.11.0-alpha wheels. Coverage.py uses CPython
  internal fields which are moving during the alpha phase. Fixes `issue 1316`_.

Version 6.3 — 2022-01-25
------------------------

- Feature: Added the ``lcov`` command to generate reports in LCOV format.
  Thanks, `Bradley Burns <pull 1289_>`_. Closes issues `587 <issue 587_>`_
  and `626 <issue 626_>`_.

- Feature: the coverage data file can now be specified on the command line with
  the ``--data-file`` option in any command that reads or writes data.  This is
  in addition to the existing ``COVERAGE_FILE`` environment variable.  Closes
  `issue 624`_. Thanks, `Nikita Bloshchanevich <pull 1304_>`_.

- Feature: coverage measurement data will now be written when a SIGTERM signal
  is received by the process.  This includes
  :meth:`Process.terminate <python:multiprocessing.Process.terminate>`,
  and other ways to terminate a process.  Currently this is only on Linux and
  Mac; Windows is not supported.  Fixes `issue 1307`_.

- Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached end-of-life on 2021-12-23.

- Updated Python 3.11 support to 3.11.0a4, fixing `issue 1294`_.

- Fix: the coverage data file is now created in a more robust way, to avoid
  problems when multiple processes are trying to write data at once. Fixes
  issues `1303 <issue 1303_>`_ and `883 <issue 883_>`_.

- Fix: a .gitignore file will only be written into the HTML report output
  directory if the directory is empty.  This should prevent certain unfortunate
  accidents of writing the file where it is not wanted.

- Releases now have MacOS arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon, fixing `issue 1288`_.

.. _changes_62:

Version 6.2 — 2021-11-26
------------------------

- Feature: Now the ``--concurrency`` setting can have a list of values, so that
  threads and another lightweight threading package can be measured together,
  such as ``--concurrency=gevent,thread``.  Closes `issue 1012`_ and `issue
  1082`_.  This also means that ``thread`` must be explicitly specified in some
  cases that used to be implicit such as ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``,
  which must be changed to ``--concurrency=multiprocessing,thread``.

- Fix: A module specified as the ``source`` setting is imported during startup,
  before the user program imports it.  This could cause problems if the rest of
  the program isn't ready yet.  For example, `issue 1203`_ describes a Django
  setting that is accessed before settings have been configured.  Now the early
  import is wrapped in a try/except so errors then don't stop execution.

- Fix: A colon in a decorator expression would cause an exclusion to end too
  early, preventing the exclusion of the decorated function. This is now fixed.

- Fix: The HTML report now will not overwrite a .gitignore file that already
  exists in the HTML output directory (follow-on for `issue 1244
  <issue 1244b_>`_).

- API: The exceptions raised by Coverage.py have been specialized, to provide
  finer-grained catching of exceptions by third-party code.

- API: Using ``suffix=False`` when constructing a Coverage object with
  multiprocessing wouldn't suppress the data file suffix (`issue 989`_).  This
  is now fixed.

- Debug: The ``coverage debug data`` command will now sniff out combinable data
  files, and report on all of them.

- Debug: The ``coverage debug`` command used to accept a number of topics at a
  time, and show all of them, though this was never documented.  This no longer
  works, to allow for command-line options in the future.

Version 6.1.2 — 2021-11-10
--------------------------

- Python 3.11 is supported (tested with 3.11.0a2).  One still-open issue has to
  do with `exits through with-statements <issue 1270_>`_.

- Fix: When remapping file paths through the ``[paths]`` setting while
  combining, the ``[run] relative_files`` setting was ignored, resulting in
  absolute paths for remapped file names (`issue 1147`_).  This is now fixed.

- Fix: Complex conditionals over excluded lines could have incorrectly reported
  a missing branch (`issue 1271`_). This is now fixed.

- Fix: More exceptions are now handled when trying to parse source files for
  reporting.  Problems that used to terminate coverage.py can now be handled
  with ``[report] ignore_errors``.  This helps with plugins failing to read
  files (`django_coverage_plugin issue 78`_).

- Fix: Removed another vestige of jQuery from the source tarball
  (`issue 840 <issue 840b_>`_).

- Fix: Added a default value for a new-to-6.x argument of an internal class.
  This unsupported class is being used by coveralls (`issue 1273`_). Although
  I'd rather not "fix" unsupported interfaces, it's actually nicer with a
  default value.

Version 6.1.1 — 2021-10-31
--------------------------

- Fix: The sticky header on the HTML report didn't work unless you had branch
  coverage enabled. This is now fixed: the sticky header works for everyone.
  (Do people still use coverage without branch measurement!? j/k)

- Fix: When using explicitly declared namespace packages, the "already imported
  a file that will be measured" warning would be issued (`issue 888`_).  This
  is now fixed.

.. _issue 888: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/888


.. _changes_61:

Version 6.1 — 2021-10-30
------------------------

- Deprecated: The ``annotate`` command and the ``Coverage.annotate`` function
  will be removed in a future version, unless people let me know that they are
  using it.  Instead, the ``html`` command gives better-looking (and more
  accurate) output, and the ``report -m`` command will tell you line numbers of
  missing lines.  Please get in touch if you have a reason to use ``annotate``
  over those better options: ned@nedbatchelder.com.

- Feature: Coverage now sets an environment variable, ``COVERAGE_RUN`` when
  running your code with the ``coverage run`` command.  The value is not
  important, and may change in the future.  Closes `issue 553`_.

- Feature: The HTML report pages for Python source files now have a sticky
  header so the file name and controls are always visible.

- Feature: The ``xml`` and ``json`` commands now describe what they wrote
  where.

- Feature: The ``html``, ``combine``, ``xml``, and ``json`` commands all accept
  a ``-q/--quiet`` option to suppress the messages they write to stdout about
  what they are doing (`issue 1254`_).

- Feature: The ``html`` command writes a ``.gitignore`` file into the HTML
  output directory, to prevent the report from being committed to git.  If you
  want to commit it, you will need to delete that file.  Closes `issue 1244`_.

- Feature: Added support for PyPy 3.8.

- Fix: More generated code is now excluded from measurement.  Code such as
  `attrs`_ boilerplate, or doctest code, was being measured though the
  synthetic line numbers meant they were never reported.  Once Cython was
  involved though, the generated .so files were parsed as Python, raising
  syntax errors, as reported in `issue 1160`_.  This is now fixed.

- Fix: When sorting human-readable names, numeric components are sorted
  correctly: file10.py will appear after file9.py.  This applies to file names,
  module names, environment variables, and test contexts.

- Performance: Branch coverage measurement is faster, though you might only
  notice on code that is executed many times, such as long-running loops.

- Build: jQuery is no longer used or vendored (`issue 840`_ and `issue 1118`_).
  Huge thanks to Nils Kattenbeck (septatrix) for the conversion to vanilla
  JavaScript in `pull request 1248`_.

Version 6.0.2 — 2021-10-11
--------------------------

- Namespace packages being measured weren't properly handled by the new code
  that ignores third-party packages. If the namespace package was installed, it
  was ignored as a third-party package.  That problem (`issue 1231`_) is now
  fixed.

- Packages named as "source packages" (with ``source``, or ``source_pkgs``, or
  pytest-cov's ``--cov``) might have been only partially measured.  Their
  top-level statements could be marked as un-executed, because they were
  imported by coverage.py before measurement began (`issue 1232`_).  This is
  now fixed, but the package will be imported twice, once by coverage.py, then
  again by your test suite.  This could cause problems if importing the package
  has side effects.

- The :meth:`.CoverageData.contexts_by_lineno` method was documented to return
  a dict, but was returning a defaultdict.  Now it returns a plain dict.  It
  also no longer returns negative numbered keys.

Version 6.0.1 — 2021-10-06
--------------------------

- In 6.0, the coverage.py exceptions moved from coverage.misc to
  coverage.exceptions. These exceptions are not part of the public supported
  API, CoverageException is. But a number of other third-party packages were
  importing the exceptions from coverage.misc, so they are now available from
  there again (`issue 1226`_).

- Changed an internal detail of how tomli is imported, so that tomli can use
  coverage.py for their own test suite (`issue 1228`_).

- Defend against an obscure possibility under code obfuscation, where a
  function can have an argument called "self", but no local named "self"
  (`pull request 1210`_).  Thanks, Ben Carlsson.

Version 6.0 — 2021-10-03
------------------------

- The ``coverage html`` command now prints a message indicating where the HTML
  report was written.  Fixes `issue 1195`_.

- The ``coverage combine`` command now prints messages indicating each data
  file being combined.  Fixes `issue 1105`_.

- The HTML report now includes a sentence about skipped files due to
  ``skip_covered`` or ``skip_empty`` settings.  Fixes `issue 1163`_.

- Unrecognized options in the configuration file are no longer errors. They are
  now warnings, to ease the use of coverage across versions.  Fixes `issue
  1035`_.

- Fix handling of exceptions through context managers in Python 3.10. A missing
  exception is no longer considered a missing branch from the with statement.
  Fixes `issue 1205`_.

- Fix another rarer instance of "Error binding parameter 0 - probably
  unsupported type." (`issue 1010 <issue 1010b_>`_).

- Creating a directory for the coverage data file now is safer against
  conflicts when two coverage runs happen simultaneously (`pull 1220`_).
  Thanks, Clément Pit-Claudel.

Version 6.0b1 — 2021-07-18
--------------------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.7, PyPy 2, and Python 3.5.

- Added support for the Python 3.10 ``match/case`` syntax.

- Data collection is now thread-safe.  There may have been rare instances of
  exceptions raised in multi-threaded programs.

- Plugins (like the `Django coverage plugin`_) were generating "Already
  imported a file that will be measured" warnings about Django itself.  These
  have been fixed, closing `issue 1150`_.

- Warnings generated by coverage.py are now real Python warnings.

- Using ``--fail-under=100`` with coverage near 100% could result in the
  self-contradictory message :code:`total of 100 is less than fail-under=100`.
  This bug (`issue 1168`_) is now fixed.

- The ``COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE`` environment variable now accepts ``stdout`` and
  ``stderr`` to write to those destinations.

- TOML parsing now uses the `tomli`_ library.

- Some minor changes to usually invisible details of the HTML report:

  - Use a modern hash algorithm when fingerprinting, for high-security
    environments (`issue 1189`_).  When generating the HTML report, we save the
    hash of the data, to avoid regenerating an unchanged HTML page. We used to
    use MD5 to generate the hash, and now use SHA-3-256.  This was never a
    security concern, but security scanners would notice the MD5 algorithm and
    raise a false alarm.

  - Change how report file names are generated, to avoid leading underscores
    (`issue 1167`_), to avoid rare file name collisions (`issue 584`_), and to
    avoid file names becoming too long (`issue 580`_).

Version 5.6b1 — 2021-04-13
--------------------------

Note: 5.6 final was never released. These changes are part of 6.0.

- Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting.  This solves a
  few problems:

  - Coverage will no longer report about other people's code (`issue 876`_).
    This is true even when using ``--source=.`` with a venv in the current
    directory.

  - Coverage will no longer generate "Already imported a file that will be
    measured" warnings about coverage itself (`issue 905`_).

- The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of
  code.  They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior.
  Now the highlighting is working again.

- The JSON report now includes ``percent_covered_display``, a string with the
  total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other
  reports' totals.

.. _changes_55:

Version 5.5 — 2021-02-28
------------------------

- ``coverage combine`` has a new option, ``--keep`` to keep the original data
  files after combining them.  The default is still to delete the files after
  they have been combined.  This was requested in `issue 1108`_ and implemented
  in `pull request 1110`_.  Thanks, Éric Larivière.

- When reporting missing branches in ``coverage report``, branches aren't
  reported that jump to missing lines.  This adds to the long-standing behavior
  of not reporting branches from missing lines.  Now branches are only reported
  if both the source and destination lines are executed.  Closes both `issue
  1065`_ and `issue 955`_.

- Minor improvements to the HTML report:

  - The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage
    so you don't have to fiddle with them so often, fixing `issue 1123`_.

  - It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work
    well, fixing `issue 1124`_.

- Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users
  will be more likely to understand what's happening, closing `issue 803`_.

Version 5.4 — 2021-01-24
------------------------

- The text report produced by ``coverage report`` now always outputs a TOTAL
  line, even if only one Python file is reported.  This makes regex parsing
  of the output easier.  Thanks, Judson Neer.  This had been requested a number
  of times (`issue 1086`_, `issue 922`_, `issue 732`_).

- The ``skip_covered`` and ``skip_empty`` settings in the configuration file
  can now be specified in the ``[html]`` section, so that text reports and HTML
  reports can use separate settings.  The HTML report will still use the
  ``[report]`` settings if there isn't a value in the ``[html]`` section.
  Closes `issue 1090`_.

- Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing `issue
  577`_.  Thanks, `Valentin Lab <pr1080_>`_.

- Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in
  `issue 1084`_.

- Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including `PEP 626: Precise
  line numbers for debugging and other tools <pep626_>`_.

Version 5.3.1 — 2020-12-19
--------------------------

- When using ``--source`` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous
  versions.  This performance regression is now fixed, closing `issue 1037`_.

- Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in `issue 1010`_. An
  immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying
  solution.

- The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way,
  fixing `issue 986`_.  Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez (`pull request 1066`_).

- The HTML report pages now have a :ref:`Sleepy Snake <sleepy>` favicon.

- Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).

- Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.

Version 5.3 — 2020-09-13
------------------------

- The ``source`` setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a
  module, depending on which existed.  If both interpretations were valid, it
  was assumed to be a file path.  The new ``source_pkgs`` setting can be used
  to name a package to disambiguate this case.  Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes
  `issue 268`_.

- If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record
  its information, causing an exception, as reported in `issue 1011`_.  This is
  now fixed.
