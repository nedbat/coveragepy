* Testing

- Testing of Python code is handled by tox.
    - Create and activate a virtualenv
    - pip install -r requirements/dev.pip
    - $ tox

- Testing on Linux:
    - $ docker run -it --init --rm -v `pwd`:/io quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_x86_64 /io/ci/manylinux.sh test

- For complete coverage testing:

    $ make metacov

    This will run coverage.py under its own measurement.  You can do this in
    different environments (Linux vs. Windows, for example), then copy the data
    files (.metacov.*) to one machine for combination and reporting.  To
    combine and report:

    $ make metahtml

- To run the Javascript tests:

    open tests/js/index.html in variety of browsers.
