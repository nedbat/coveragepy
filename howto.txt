* Release checklist

- Check that the current virtualenv matches the current coverage branch.
- start branch for release work
    $ make relbranch
- Edit version number in coverage/version.py
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "alpha", 1)
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "beta", 1)
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "candidate", 1)
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "final", 0)
    - make sure: _dev = 0
- Edit supported Python version numbers. Search for "PYVERSIONS".
    - Especially README.rst and doc/index.rst
- Update source files with release facts, and get useful snippets:
    $ make edit_for_release cheats
- Look over CHANGES.rst
- Update README.rst
    - "New in x.y:"
- Update docs
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        - Version of latest stable release in doc/index.rst
    - Make sure the docs are cogged:
        $ make prebuild
    - Don't forget the man page: doc/python-coverage.1.txt
    - Check that the docs build correctly:
        $ tox -e doc
- commit the release-prep changes
    $ make relcommit1
- Generate new sample_html to get the latest, incl footer version number:
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make sample_html_beta
    - IF NOT PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make sample_html
        - check in the new sample html
            $ make relcommit2
- Done with changes to source files
    - g puo; gshipit
        - check them in on the release prep branch
        - wait for ci to finish
        - merge to master
        - git push
- Start the kits:
    - opvars github
    - Trigger the kit GitHub Action
        $ make build_kits
- Build and publish docs:
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make publishbeta
    - ELSE:
        $ make publish
    - commit and publish nedbatchelder.com
- Kits:
    - Wait for kits to finish:
        - https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/actions/workflows/kit.yml
    - test the pypi upload:
        $ make test_upload
        - you'll need to approve the action
    - upload kits:
        $ make pypi_upload
        - you'll need to approve the action
- Tag the tree
    $ make tag
- Update GitHub releases:
    $ make clean github_releases
- Visit the fixed issues on GitHub and mention the version it was fixed in.
    $ make comment_on_fixes
- deopvars
- Bump version:
    $ make bump_version
- Update readthedocs
    - @ https://readthedocs.org/projects/coverage/versions/
        - find the latest tag in the inactive list, edit it, make it active.
        - keep just the latest version of each x.y release, make the rest active but hidden.
            - pre-releases should be hidden
    - IF NOT PRE-RELEASE:
        - @ https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/coverage/advanced/
            - change the "default version" to the new version
- Once CI passes, merge the bump-version branch to master and push it
    - gshipit

- things to automate:
    - readthedocs api to do the readthedocs changes


* Testing

- Testing of Python code is handled by tox.
    - Create and activate a virtualenv
    - pip install -r requirements/dev.pip
    - $ tox

- For complete coverage testing:

    $ make metacov

    This will run coverage.py under its own measurement.  You can do this in
    different environments (Linux vs. Windows, for example), then copy the data
    files (.metacov.*) to one machine for combination and reporting.  To
    combine and report:

    $ make metahtml

- To run the Javascript tests:

    open tests/js/index.html in variety of browsers.
